**Title:** The Green Isle to the Gilded City

**Subtitle:** An Unlikely Aliyah of Bureaucracy, Absinthe, and Anteaters

**Blurb:** For Daniel, an Irish Jew yearning for Jerusalem, the path of Aliyah is paved not with gold, but with bewildering red tape and a mandatory, perilous overland journey. Accompanied only by his archaic tongue and a cynical, anteater-obsessed talking sloth he met over absinthe, his pilgrimage becomes a testament to the absurd lengths one must go for home.

**Introduction: Emerald Roots, Distant Stars**

Mine own beginning was upon Eire's green shore, a land of soft rain and softer light, where the ancient stones whispered tales not quite mine own. I am Daniel, son of Abraham by lineage though not by landscape, born amidst the rolling hills and peat-smoke air, a Jew in a land predominantly marked by the Cross and the Harp. 'Twas a goodly youth, I shall not gainsay it; the folk were kind, the fields fertile to the eye, yet ever did I feel a subtle dissonance, a string within my soul tuned to a key unheard in the local airs.

As seasons turned and boyhood waned, yielding place to the sturdier thoughts of man, this sense of otherness did not diminish but deepen. It was not malice I felt from those around me, nay, but a gentle incomprehension, a curiosity that marked me as apart. My family, though small, held fast to the traditions passed down, lighting the Sabbath candles, recounting tales of Moses and the Maccabees. Yet these felt like embers glowing in a hearth far removed from the main fire.

Then came the dawning age of the interconnected world, a marvel woven from wires and whispers of light. First through crackling dial-up tones, then the swiftness of broadband's stream, and yes, even by the silvered discs men called CDs and the spoken tracts of podcasts, did the wider tapestry of my heritage unfold before me. Voices from Jerusalem, New York, London – scholars, rabbis, simple folk – spoke of Torah, of Talmud, of a living, breathing tradition that resonated with that quiet, untuned string within. It was a revelation whispered across the digital void, a homecoming discovered whilst seated still in my Irish room.

The lore, the laws, the intricate dance of observance – these drew me nigh. The concept of *Aliyah*, the great ascent, the return to Zion, began not as a plan, but as a yearning, a magnetic pull towards a centre I had known only in prayer and pixelated image. It grew from a whisper to a resonant hum, the guiding star of my burgeoning self. Upon the completion of my first honest toil, earning coin in the world's mart, the hum became a call insistent. The time felt ripe, the path, though misty, beckoned. Jerusalem awaited. Little did I reckon the labyrinth that lay betwixt the dream and the dawn.

**# Chapter 1: The Call and the Quill-Pushers**

The decision, once forged in the heart's deep furnace, felt as solid as the Giant's Causeway stones. Jerusalem! The word itself was a balm, a promise whispered across millennia. To make *Aliyah*, to ascend unto the land of mine forefathers, seemed the most natural culmination of my being, the inevitable answer to that lifelong question humming beneath the surface of my days. With the fervour of a knight embarking upon a holy quest, I turned my mind towards the practicalities.

Alas, the path to Zion proved less a sunlit ascent and more a descent into a shadowed valley choked with parchment and perplexity. The initial steps involved navigating the digital portals of the Jewish Agency and the Israeli Ministry of Interior. Websites bloomed upon my screen, resplendent with Hebrew script and optimistic photographs of smiling *olim*, new immigrants basking beneath the Middle Eastern sun. Yet, beneath this welcoming facade lay a thicket of forms, questionnaires, and demands for documentation that seemed designed by minds delighting in obfuscation.

"Pray, what manner of document doth attest to the faith of my grandsire's grandsire?" I muttered, peering at a dropdown menu offering options as arcane as alchemical formulae. Each click led deeper into a maze. Links promised clarity but delivered only further questions. Instructions, translated into English with a peculiar, bureaucratic stiffness, often contradicted one another.

I sought guidance. Phone numbers were provided, promising assistance from helpful emissaries. Yet, dialling these led often to the melancholic drone of an unanswered ringing, or worse, an automated voice reciting options in Hebrew, a tongue I knew then only from prayer books and the aforementioned online tutors, scarcely sufficient for navigating the Scylla and Charybdis of automated telephony. Emails dispatched into the electronic ether vanished without reply, like messages cast adrift in corked bottles upon a boundless sea.

Days turned into weeks. My initial ardour began to cool, replaced by a gnawing frustration. I gathered documents: birth certificates, letters from rabbis known only through flickering screens, proofs of lineage stretching back through the misty annals of my family's Irish sojourn. Each paper seemed to beget the need for another, a hydra-headed beast of bureaucracy. I felt less like a prospective citizen answering a call and more like a petitioner begging entrance at a thrice-locked gate, guarded by unseen, indifferent sentinels. Was this the welcome Zion offered? This thicket of thorns guarding the rose? The doubt, unwelcome yet persistent, began to whisper at the edges of my resolve.

**# Chapter 2: The London Fog and Further Forms**

The digital labyrinth proving impassable, word came – or rather, was eventually deciphered from a rare, successful email exchange – that certain matters required corporeal presence. Not in Dublin, mind you, where a modest embassy wing might suffice, but across the Irish Sea, in the great and sprawling wen of London. An interview, they termed it, a necessary step to verify the bona fides of this Hibernian son of Israel.

Thus, necessity dictated a journey. A short hop by modern reckoning, yet it felt like the first leg of a far grander, more daunting expedition. The ferry churned across the grey waters, the familiar green fading behind, replaced by the chalky cliffs of Albion. England! A land known to me through tales and histories, yet unfamiliar beneath my feet. Disembarking, I found myself adrift in a tide of bustling strangers, the air thick with accents diverse and purposes unknown.

London itself was a behemoth, a roaring, clamouring entity that swallowed me whole. Navigating its tangled Underground, deciphering the cryptic maps, finding the designated office – all became minor trials preceding the main event. The embassy building, imposing and severe, stood guarded by men whose eyes missed naught. Within its walls, the air hummed with a low-level anxiety, the shared tension of supplicants awaiting judgement.

The interview itself was... peculiar. A stern-faced woman, peering over formidable spectacles, posed questions that ranged from the intimate details of my family history ("And your mother's mother, her maiden name, you say?") to probing inquiries about my motivations ("Why *now*? What prospects await thee in Israel?"). My replies, couched in mine own particular cadence of English, seemed neither to surprise nor amuse her. She simply ticked boxes on a form, her expression unreadable.

"Thy documentation seems mostly in order," she conceded at length, shuffling papers with an air of profound weariness. "Yet, this confirmation from Rabbi Levinstein – it lacks the official stamp. And the translation of thy great-aunt's marriage ketubah requires notarization by an approved translator. Attend to these matters, and resubmit the relevant forms."

More forms? More stamps? Another quest for obscure certifications? A wave of fatigue washed over me. The journey, the expense, the sheer, grinding effort required for each incremental step – it felt Sisyphean. I had crossed the sea merely to be handed another boulder to push uphill. Emerging back into the London drizzle, the city's grey indifference seemed to mirror the bureaucratic chill I had just endured. The path to Jerusalem seemed not shorter, but longer, its end shrouded in a fog as thick as the one descending upon the Thames.

---

**# Chapter 3: The Whispers of Defeat**

Back upon Eire's soil, the London fog seemed to have followed me, settling not upon the landscape, but within my spirit. The list of required amendments, notarizations, and officially stamped confirmations lay upon my desk like a taunting riddle. Finding an "approved translator" for a faded, Aramaic-laced marriage contract from decades past proved an odyssey in itself. Locating the elusive Rabbi Levinstein, a venerable scholar I knew only from his online lectures, to procure a physically stamped letter required navigating time zones and the goodwill of intermediaries.

Each task became a source of fresh frustration. Phone calls met automated menus or silent lines. Emails received replies days later, often requesting *further* clarification or pointing towards yet another form. The postal service, usually reliable, seemed to conspire against me; crucial documents took weeks to arrive, or were returned marked 'address unknown'. It was as though the very universe had developed a sudden, inexplicable inefficiency centred entirely upon my *Aliyah* application.

There were days, dark and rain-lashed, when the sheer absurdity of it all threatened to overwhelm me. I sat staring at the computer screen, the official portal radiating a cold, digital indifference. Why this struggle? Why this labyrinthine process for one seeking only to answer a call of heritage, a pull towards a spiritual home? Was the State of Israel truly so besieged by hopeful immigrants that it must erect such formidable barriers? Or was there some hidden test, some arcane trial by ordeal designed to weed out the faint of heart?

Thoughts of surrender, unwelcome spectres, began to haunt my waking hours. Perhaps this dream was but folly. Perhaps my place was here, in the familiar green, however dissonant the inner tune. The comfort of the known, the ease of abandoning the fight, beckoned like a siren's song. I pictured myself years hence, still in Ireland, the yearning for Jerusalem a faded ache, a story told with a wry shake of the head about the time I *almost* moved. The thought brought a chill deeper than the Irish damp.

Friends and family offered encouragement, yet their words often felt distant, unable to grasp the peculiar, soul-grinding nature of this bureaucratic warfare. "Keep at it, Danny," they'd say, meaning well. "Sure, it'll come right in the end." But would it? The end seemed perpetually receding, a shimmering mirage in a desert of paperwork. Doubt, sharp and cold, pricked at the edges of my resolve. Perchance, I mused darkly, this quest was not meant to be.

---

**# Chapter 4: A Fleeting Dawn, A Shadowed Morn**

Then, as inexplicably as the delays had plagued me, came the breakthrough. An email arrived, stark and official, nestled amongst the usual dross. It bore the digital crest of the Ministry of Interior. My heart gave a great leap, a flutter of fearful hope. With trembling hand, I clicked it open.

"Dear Mr. Daniel [Surname Redacted]," it began, the formal language a stark contrast to the turmoil within me. "Following review of your application and supporting documentation, we are pleased to inform you that your request for Aliyah under the Law of Return has been approved."

Approved! The word shone upon the screen like a beacon. A wave of relief so profound washed over me that I felt light-headed. I had prevailed! The forms, the stamps, the London journey, the gnawing doubt – all vanquished. Jerusalem! The dream was tangible now, within reach. A grin spread across my face, wide and unrestrained. I read the sentence again, and then again, savouring each syllable.

My elation, however, proved as fleeting as a winter sunbeam. For the email continued, detailing the next steps, and nestled within the procedural paragraphs lay a sentence that snagged my eye, jarring and dissonant. "Pursuant to recent legislative updates (Regulation 4B/7 subsection Gamma), promoting national sustainability initiatives, Aliyah travel arrangements will no longer be facilitated by air."

No longer by air? I blinked, rereading the line. What madness was this? Traditionally, the Jewish Agency or related bodies had provided new *olim* with a one-way flight ticket, a practical gesture acknowledging the significance and frequent financial strain of the move. This new regulation, cloaked in the virtuous language of "sustainability," seemed utterly bizarre.

The email elaborated, albeit vaguely. "Approved immigrants are required to arrange passage to Israel via the most sustainable means feasible from their point of origin. Guidance on approved routes and carriers can be sought..." Another link, another portal.

A cold dread began to replace the warmth of relief. From Ireland, an island nation, what could "sustainable means" possibly entail? Swimming was out of the question. A slow boat, perhaps? But where would one find a regular ferry service charting a course from Cork Harbour to Haifa Port? The implications began to dawn, vast and unsettling. This wasn't just an inconvenience; it was a fundamental redefinition of the journey, transforming it from a simple flight into... what? A convoluted, potentially perilous overland trek?

The approval felt suddenly hollow, the victory tainted. The path to Jerusalem, which had seemed finally clear, was now obscured by a new, entirely unexpected, and profoundly daunting obstacle. The dawn of permission had arrived, only to be swiftly followed by the shadowed morn of impossible logistics. This regulation, ostensibly for tax savings or ecological virtue, felt like another barrier, perhaps the most formidable yet.

---

**# Chapter 5: Charting an Impossible Course**

The "guidance" promised on the official portal proved as helpful as a map drawn in invisible ink. It spoke grandly of carbon footprints, of prioritising rail and sea travel over aviation, yet offered precious little in practical terms for an individual starting from the western edge of Europe. There were vague references to pan-European train networks and ferry crossings in the Mediterranean, but piecing together a viable route from Ireland to Israel felt like assembling a jigsaw puzzle with half the pieces missing, and the remaining ones belonging to different sets entirely.

Days were spent poring over maps, ferry schedules, and train timetables spanning a dozen countries. The route began to take shape, not as a clear path, but as a meandering, continent-spanning crawl. A ferry from Ireland to Britain. Travel across Britain – how? Hitchhiking? Bus? Train? – to reach the Channel Tunnel or another ferry port. Then, the true complexity began: traversing France, perhaps Germany or Switzerland, down through Italy or the Balkans, navigating the tangled web of railways and borders.

And then? The Mediterranean Sea lay between Europe and the Levant. Ferries existed, yes, but they were infrequent, often connecting obscure ports, and sailed through waters increasingly troubled by geopolitical currents. Turkey? Greece? Cyprus? Each option presented its own challenges, its own visa requirements (potentially), its own uncertainties. The final leg, crossing into Israel itself, seemed shrouded in mist.

The sheer impracticality was staggering. This journey would take weeks, perhaps longer. It would involve countless changes, potential delays, language barriers, and border crossings in regions where tensions often simmered beneath the surface. And all because of a law seemingly drafted by officials with little grasp of geography or the realities faced by those they purported to welcome. "Sustainable," they called it. Arduous, perilous, nigh-on impossible, felt more apt.

The financial implications were also daunting. While the flight might have been covered previously, this sprawling overland odyssey would require funding for dozens of separate tickets, accommodation along the way, food, and unforeseen expenses. My modest savings, carefully accrued for settling into a new life in Jerusalem, looked pitifully inadequate for such a protracted and uncertain voyage.

Yet, what choice had I? The permission was granted, conditional upon this bizarre mode of travel. To refuse was to forfeit the dream entirely. To complain seemed futile, akin to shouting at the wind. With a heavy heart, and a sense of embarking upon something truly, deeply strange, I began to make the first, tentative plans. The initial step: get off the island of Ireland and across Britain to London, the gateway, it seemed, not only for bureaucracy but now for the commencement of this enforced pilgrimage. The quest for Zion had become a test of endurance before it had even truly begun.

**# Chapter 6: Farewells and the Thumb of Fate**

The farewells were tinged with a peculiar blend of pride and bewilderment. My family, bless their hearts, struggled to comprehend the necessity of this grand, circuitous trek. "But... can you not just fly, Daniel?" my mother asked, her brow furrowed with concern. Explaining the bureaucratic dictate of "sustainability" elicited blank stares or head-shaking sighs. Still, they wished me well, pressing small gifts and blessings into my hands, their love a tangible warmth against the uncertainty ahead.

Leaving the familiar embrace of home, the green hills receding in the bus window, tugged at my heartstrings more keenly than I'd anticipated. Each landmark passed felt like a small severance. Yet, beneath the melancholy lay a thrum of nervous energy, the undeniable pull of the journey itself, however strangely mandated.

My funds being meagre, the passage across Britain was to be accomplished by the most ancient and arguably sustainable method of all: the extended thumb. Hitchhiking. It felt simultaneously liberating and terrifying. Standing by the roadside as cars whizzed past, my rucksack a heavy companion, I felt utterly exposed, reliant on the kindness of strangers.

The first ride came surprisingly quickly, a garrulous farmer heading to market. He spoke of crops and weather, his earthy common sense a stark contrast to the bureaucratic maze I had just navigated. He dropped me further down the road, wishing me luck with a baffled shake of his head when I explained my ultimate destination and mode of travel.

And so it went, a patchwork of short lifts and long waits. Kind souls, curious souls, silent souls. A lorry driver hauling timber, a young couple heading to a music festival, a retired schoolteacher visiting her sister. Each ride was a self-contained story, a fleeting glimpse into other lives. I offered my thanks in my usual manner, my Shakespearean lilt often met with a raised eyebrow or a hesitant smile, but never, blessedly, with outright mockery or pointed questions. Perhaps they assumed I was an eccentric academic, or an actor en route to some obscure performance.

The miles crawled by. England unfolded outside the windows – motorways, villages, sprawling suburbs. Fatigue began to set in, the constant uncertainty of the next ride, the cumulative weight of the rucksack and the journey's strangeness pressing down. Finally, after what felt like an age of roadside vigils and fleeting conversations, the sprawl of London began to encroach. The rides became shorter, the traffic thicker. A final lift deposited me on the outskirts, amidst a cacophony of noise and motion.

I had made it to London, the first major staging post. But exhaustion gnawed at me. My clothes were travel-stained, my muscles ached, and my mind felt frayed by the constant low-level anxiety of the road. Before facing the complexities of crossing the Channel and navigating Europe, I needed respite. I needed solid ground beneath my feet. And perchance, I thought with a sudden, weary craving, a pint of good English ale. Nay, something stronger. Something to quiet the clamour within and without. A nearby pub sign, dimly lit in the gathering dusk, beckoned like a sanctuary.

---

**# Chapter 7: Of Ales, Absinthe, and Unexpected Company**

The pub was called 'The Wandering Scholar,' a name that struck me as wryly appropriate. Inside, it was all dark wood, brass fittings, and the low murmur of conversation, a haven from the city's relentless thrum. I found a secluded corner booth, slid my rucksack gratefully onto the bench beside me, and approached the bar.

"Good sir," I addressed the stout barman, "prithee, pour me a measure of thy finest ale, something stout to mend a weary traveller's spirit."

The barman, a man whose face suggested he'd seen all manner of oddity wander through his doors, simply nodded. "Pint of stout it is, mate."

The ale was cool and dark, its bitterness welcome on my parched throat. Yet, the weariness remained, a deep ache in bone and soul. My gaze drifted along the shelves behind the bar, laden with bottles of varying shapes and hues. One, a vibrant green, caught my eye. Absinthe. The Green Fairy. Tales of its potent, mind-altering properties flickered through my fatigue-addled brain. Perchance... perchance just a dram. To truly smooth the ruffled edges of this arduous day.

"And might I trouble thee further," I ventured, returning to the barman, "for but a small glass of that verdant elixir yonder? The absinthe, if it please thee."

He raised an eyebrow slightly this time, but complied, setting down a small glass filled with the shimmering liquid and, blessedly, a carafe of iced water and a slotted spoon with a sugar cube, demonstrating the traditional ritual. I dripped the water slowly, watching the green cloud and swirl, the louche effect mesmerising. The aroma, anise and herbs, filled the small space around me. I took a sip. It was potent, fiery, yet strangely clarifying, cutting through the fog of exhaustion.

I returned to my booth, savouring the slow burn of the absinthe after the heartening bitterness of the ale. The pub's low lighting seemed to soften, the background chatter becoming a gentle hum. I leaned back, closing my eyes for a moment, adrift in a peculiar sea of fatigue, alcohol, and relief.

"A rather contemplative state for one embarking on such a venture, wouldn't you say?"

The voice was high-pitched, precise, and startlingly close. My eyes snapped open. Sitting on the bench opposite me, where my rucksack had been moments before (or had it?), was a creature of impossible aspect. It was a sloth. Not a large one, perhaps fourteen inches from head to diminutive rump, covered in greyish-brown fur, with the characteristic slow-blinking eyes and a faint, almost enigmatic smile. It was holding a miniature glass – identical to my absinthe glass – in one of its three-clawed paws.

I stared. Surely, the ale, the absinthe, the sheer exhaustion... they were playing tricks upon my senses. A sloth. In a London pub. *Speaking*.

"Forgive my intrusion," the sloth continued, taking a delicate sip from its glass. "But I overheard your earlier exchange with the barkeep. A traveller, weary, seeking solace. And your destination, if my eavesdropping serves me well, is rather... ambitious."

I found my voice, though it felt thick and uncertain. "Good... good creature? Art thou... art thou real? Or doth the Green Fairy play havoc with mine eyes?"

The sloth chuckled, a dry, rustling sound. "Oh, I assure you, I am quite real. As real as the bureaucratic entanglement that necessitates journeys such as ours. Cornelius, at your service." He executed a slow, deliberate nod. "And you, I gather, are the fellow with the rather… florid mode of address?"

A speaking sloth named Cornelius. Drinking absinthe. Inquiring about my journey. The world had tilted entirely off its axis. Yet, strangely, amidst the utter absurdity, there was a peculiar calmness emanating from the creature. And nobody else in the pub seemed to pay him the slightest heed.

---

**# Chapter 8: Cornelius and the Anteater Conjecture**

"Cornelius," I repeated, the name feeling alien and yet strangely fitting on my tongue. "Thou speakest English with remarkable facility. By what sorcery or strange science doth a creature of the South American jungle master the tongue of Shakespeare and Shaw?"

Cornelius waved a claw dismissively, nearly spilling his absinthe. "Oh, 'tis no sorcery, merely applied science. A rather ingenious neural interface, developed by some frightfully clever chaps in neuro-linguistics and AI. Translates thought directly into audible speech comprehensible to your species. I am, you might be interested to know, one of only three sloths globally to have achieved this level of fluency. The others reside in Korea and Japan – delightful correspondents via Zoom, though frankly, I suspect they might be deepfakes. Possibly an anteater ploy."

"Anteater?" I queried, bewildered. "What have anteaters to do with..."

"Everything!" Cornelius declared, his voice rising slightly with sudden intensity. "Mark my words, those long-snouted menaces are the hidden architects of global inconvenience! They thrive on inefficiency, on pointless complexity. This whole 'sustainable travel' mandate forcing us onto this ridiculous overland route? It has the sticky fingerprints of an anteater venture all over it! Designed purely to frustrate and delay, while they presumably scheme in their subterranean lairs."

He took another sip of absinthe, calming himself. "But I digress. The point is, the technology exists. And, as it happens, I too am bound for Jerusalem. There's a pilot program, you see. Integrating 'alternatively-vocal' species into Israeli society. Highly experimental. And, naturally, subject to the same ludicrous travel restrictions as yourself."

He peered at me with his slow-blinking eyes. "So, we find ourselves in the same predicament, Master...?"

"Daniel," I supplied, still reeling slightly. "Daniel of Ireland."

"Master Daniel," Cornelius acknowledged with another slow nod. "It seems fate, or perhaps merely the shared absurdity of our respective bureaucracies, has thrown us together. Two pilgrims on an enforcedly 'green' path to the Holy Land. Given the manifest impracticalities of solo travel under these conditions – especially for one of my... deliberate pacing – might I propose an alliance? A temporary partnership for the duration of this continental crawl?"

A partnership? With a talking sloth nursing a conspiracy theory about anteaters? The proposition was ludicrous. And yet... And yet, there was an undeniable intelligence in his eyes, a resourcefulness hinted at beneath the bizarre pronouncements. And the thought of navigating the complexities of Europe alone suddenly felt even more daunting. Furthermore, was he truly real, or a figment conjured by fatigue and the potent green liqueur? If the latter, arguing seemed pointless. If the former... well, the journey was already strange beyond measure. What was one more layer of奇?

"An alliance," I mused. "Thou art small, Master Cornelius, yet thy words suggest a mind exceeding thy stature. Perchance two heads – one human, one... sloth – are better than one upon this path fraught with peril and peculiarity. Very well. Let us face this 'anteater venture,' as thou termest it, together."

Cornelius raised his glass. "Excellent. To Jerusalem, then. May our journey be swift – relatively speaking – and free of any actual anteaters."

I clinked my glass against his miniature one, the sound barely audible above the pub's hum. The alliance was sealed, born of exhaustion, absinthe, and the shared lunacy of our government-mandated quest. Whether Cornelius was a product of the Green Fairy or a genuine, AI-enhanced, anteater-phobic sloth remained unclear, but for now, he was my companion.

---

**# Chapter 9: Of Ferries, Trains, and Cautious Whispers**

The following morn found me blessedly free of any ill effects from the absinthe, save for a lingering sense of unreality. Yet, Cornelius was undeniably present, perched calmly on my rucksack as I checked out of the modest lodging I'd found near the pub. He seemed less a figment of imagination and more a solid, albeit small and slow-moving, reality.

"First order of business, Daniel," he stated, his voice crisp in the morning air, "is securing passage across La Manche. The Channel Tunnel, I believe, presents the most direct route for rail continuity."

His practicality was strangely grounding. While I was still grappling with the sheer weirdness of conversing with a sloth, Cornelius was focused on logistics. His diminutive size proved both a blessing and a curse. He was easily portable, often riding atop my rucksack like a furry, sentient hood ornament, but navigating crowds and ticket barriers required a degree of manoeuvring.

At St Pancras Station, the grandeur of the international terminal a stark contrast to our odd pairing, Cornelius's presence elicited curious glances but, remarkably, no official intervention. Perhaps, I mused, Londoners were simply inured to strangeness. Or perhaps Cornelius, when he chose, could affect an air of such profound normalcy – for a sloth – that people simply edited him out of their perception.

"Tickets for two to Paris, if you please," Cornelius instructed me quietly as we approached the counter, having coached me beforehand. "One standard adult, and one... companion fare. Specify 'special needs transport,' perhaps? Less likely to invite awkward questions than 'one talking sloth'."

The subterfuge worked. The ticket agent, preoccupied with the screen, barely glanced down as she processed the transaction. Cornelius remained still and silent atop the bag during the critical moment.

On the Eurostar, speeding beneath the English Channel, the need for discretion became more apparent. We found seats facing each other, Cornelius occupying the one opposite me. "Now, Daniel," he whispered, leaning forward conspiratorially, "we must be circumspect about our ultimate destination. 'Jerusalem' is a word freighted with... complexities in certain parts of the continent we must traverse. Political sensitivities, historical grievances, the usual human muddle. Best to maintain a lower profile. If asked, we are perhaps... academics? Heading to a conference in, say, Athens? Vague, but respectable."

"Academics?" I pondered. "What manner of study should we profess?"

"Hmm," Cornelius mused, tapping a claw against his chin. "Given your rather unique vernacular, perhaps Elizabethan poetry? And I," he added with a faint smirk, "am a specialist in comparative mythology, with a focus on pan-continental trickster figures. Plausible, wouldn't you agree? And sufficiently dull to deter further inquiry."

It seemed as good a fabrication as any. The journey ahead was not merely physical, but would require a constant performance, a masking of our true purpose. The weight of this secrecy added another layer to the already heavy burden of the trip. As the train emerged into the sunlight of Calais, France spread before us, the next stage in a long and increasingly complex game of transit and deception. Cornelius, despite his earlier anteater-centric pronouncements, was proving surprisingly adept at navigating the human world's peculiar rules. His arrogance was tempered by a sharp, practical intelligence that I was beginning to appreciate, even as I struggled to reconcile it with the image of a small, slow-moving mammal.

---

**# Chapter 10: Across Gaul and Towards the Rhine**

France unfurled from the train window – fields of vibrant yellow rapeseed, tidy villages clustered around ancient church spires, the effortless elegance of Parisian architecture glimpsed during our swift transit through the capital's Gare du Nord to catch a connecting service eastward. Cornelius observed it all with a detached, almost clinical interest.

"Remarkable efficiency, the French rail system," he commented, peering out at a passing high-speed TGV. "Though one suspects an underlying fragility. Too much reliance on centralised control. A system ripe for disruption by… well, you know." He didn't need to say 'anteaters'.

Navigating the French leg was relatively straightforward, thanks to the interconnected nature of European rail. Language proved less of a barrier than I'd feared; station signs were often multilingual, and Cornelius seemed to possess a rudimentary grasp of several European tongues, gleaned, he claimed, from "linguistic data packets" included in his AI upgrade. My own archaic English continued to be met with polite bafflement rather than hostility.

We kept our cover story – the Elizabethan scholar and the mythology expert en route to Athens. It served us well during brief interactions with conductors and fellow passengers. Most people were preoccupied with their own journeys, accepting our presence with incurious nods.

Yet, the need for subterfuge created a low hum of tension. Every official uniform, every passport check at a border (though thankfully infrequent within the Schengen Area), felt like a potential point of exposure. Our destination, Jerusalem, felt like a forbidden word, a secret we guarded closely.

Cornelius, despite his cynicism, proved an unexpectedly resourceful travel companion. He had an uncanny knack for reading timetables, identifying the most efficient connections, and even anticipating potential delays. "The 14:07 service to Strasbourg is notoriously overcrowded on Tuesdays," he'd declare, having seemingly absorbed the entire Deutsche Bahn schedule through osmosis. "Best to aim for the regional connector at 15:20, less direct, but infinitely more civilised."

His arrogance remained, a constant undercurrent. He regarded most human endeavours with a faint air of condescension. "Observe the inefficient queuing system," he might murmur at a station cafe. "Clearly no sloth was involved in its design. We understand flow." Or, critiquing a piece of public art: "Derivative. Lacks the primal authenticity one finds in, say, pre-Columbian termite mound sculpture."

Yet, his sharp intellect was undeniable. He could calculate currency conversions in his head faster than I could fumble with my phone, and his quiet observations often cut through the noise of travel, offering moments of surprising clarity. As we crossed the Rhine into Germany, the landscape changing subtly, the air growing crisper, I felt a strange sense of camaraderie with this most unlikely of companions. We were bound together by a shared, absurd mission, navigating a continent under false pretences, propelled by bureaucracy towards a distant, longed-for shore. The journey remained daunting, but no longer felt quite so lonely.

**# Chapter 11: Teutonic Tidiness and Seeds of Doubt**

Germany was a land of order and efficiency, a stark contrast to the more laissez-faire atmosphere we'd sometimes encountered further west. Trains ran with commendable punctuality, stations were clean, and information was displayed with unambiguous clarity. Cornelius seemed to approve.

"Ah, Teutonic precision," he remarked as we glided smoothly through the Bavarian countryside. "One almost feels the unseen hand of competent engineering. Though, naturally, such order can breed complacency. A vulnerability the long-snouted ones undoubtedly seek to exploit."

Our "academic" cover story continued to serve its purpose. We spent a night in Munich, finding lodging in a small *Gasthaus* where the proprietor, a stout woman with flour dusting her apron, seemed more interested in whether we required breakfast than in our supposed fields of study. Cornelius, discreetly tucked into a carrier bag I'd procured, remained largely unseen.

It was during a long stretch of rail travel, heading southeast towards Austria, that Cornelius offered a sliver more of his own history, albeit obliquely. We were discussing the concept of home, the magnetic pull that had drawn me towards Jerusalem despite the obstacles.

"Home," Cornelius mused, his gaze distant. "A complex notion. For some, it is a place. For others, a memory. For myself..." He paused, his usual cynicism momentarily softening. "My earliest recollections are of verdant canopies, the scent of damp earth, the constant chatter of simian neighbours. South America, of course."

"Thou hast travelled far indeed," I observed gently.

"Necessity dictated it," he said, his tone becoming guarded again. "Circumstances arose. Unpleasantness involving... predatory primates. Afterwards, pathways opened eastward. There was a period of... nomadic research... across the Eurasian steppe. Mongolia holds a certain desolate charm, you know. Very different from the jungle."

Predatory primates. Nomadic research. Mongolia. It was a fragmented, enigmatic account, hinting at dislocation and perhaps trauma, but offered with a deliberate vagueness that discouraged probing. Yet, it added another layer to the mystery of the sloth. How did a creature from the Amazon end up traversing Mongolia before arriving in Europe to receive an AI speech implant and embark on an Aliyah program? The narrative felt both too strange to be true and too specific to be entirely fabricated.

The question of his reality flickered again at the edges of my mind. Was this backstory part of an elaborate, absinthe-induced hallucination? Or was Cornelius truly this bizarre, displaced individual, his cynicism a shield against past hurts? He offered no further details, retreating into observations about the passing landscape or critiques of railway catering.

As we crossed into Austria, the Alps beginning to loom majestically in the distance, a new kind of doubt began to surface. Not about Cornelius's reality, but about the journey itself. We were moving steadily eastward, ticking off countries on the map, yet Jerusalem still felt impossibly distant. The sheer scale of the continent, the succession of borders and cultures, pressed upon me. Could we truly maintain this charade, navigate the potential pitfalls of the Balkans and beyond, relying only on my archaic English and a sloth's cynical intellect? The efficiency of Germany felt like a temporary respite before a plunge into regions known for their volatility. The path ahead seemed to grow steeper, the shadows longer.

**# Chapter 12: Balkan Borders and Rising Tensions**

Leaving the relative predictability of Austria and entering the Balkans felt like stepping into a different current. The air itself seemed charged with a more palpable history, the landscapes etched with older, deeper lines. Train journeys became less predictable, schedules looser, the rolling stock occasionally showing its age. Border crossings, even between nations nominally friendly, felt more significant, involving uniformed officials who scrutinised passports with a deliberate, unhurried intensity.

Our cover story – academics heading to Athens – began to feel thinner, less adequate. The word "Israel," unspoken, seemed to hang in the air between Cornelius and me, a destination too sensitive to even whisper. We became more guarded in our interactions, limiting conversations with fellow travellers, preferring the anonymity of crowded carriages or the solitude of brief stops in provincial towns.

Cornelius's cynicism deepened, but it was now tinged with a practical wariness. "Observe the border guard, Daniel," he murmured as we waited in a queue at the Serbian frontier. "The slight shift in his stance, the way his eyes linger. He's assessing, categorising. Humans are distressingly prone to suspicion based on superficial anomalies. Your... linguistic flair, my very existence, however discreetly managed... we represent deviations from the norm. Deviations invite scrutiny."

His anteater paranoia also adapted to the new environment. "This region," he declared, peering out at a landscape of rolling hills and small farmsteads, "is rife with ancient grudges and unresolved territorial disputes. Classic anteater manipulation. They thrive on sowing discord, distracting humanity while they pursue their nefarious tunnelling operations."

Despite the rising tension, there were moments of beauty and connection. A shared meal of hearty stew in a Belgrade station cafe, the kindness of an elderly woman on a train in Bulgaria who offered us homemade pastries, the stark, windswept beauty of the mountains passing by the window. These small graces were anchors in the swirling uncertainty of the journey.

It was in Bulgaria, waiting for a connecting train in Sofia, that we had our closest call yet. Two plainclothes officials approached us on the platform. They didn't identify themselves, but their manner was direct, their eyes sharp.

"Your passports," one demanded, his English heavily accented but clear. "And your purpose of travel?"

I produced our documents, my heart thudding against my ribs. "We are scholars, good sirs," I replied, striving for a calm I did not feel. "Bound for a symposium in Athens. I study the Elizabethan poets," I indicated myself, "and my associate," gesturing towards Cornelius, who remained utterly still and seemingly inanimate in his carrier, "is an expert in comparative mythology."

The officials exchanged glances. One peered intently at Cornelius's carrier. "And this? Your luggage?"

"My... research materials," I improvised quickly. "Fragile artefacts. Best kept close."

They scrutinised our passports again, flipping through the pages. Time seemed to stretch, each second thick with potential disaster. What if they demanded to see inside the bag? What if they questioned our ludicrous story further?

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the lead official handed back our passports with a curt nod. "Athens, you say? Be on your way."

They turned and walked off, melting back into the station crowd. I let out a breath I hadn't realised I was holding, my hand trembling slightly. Cornelius shifted in his bag.

"Too close," he whispered, his voice tight. "That was not mere curiosity. That was targeted suspicion. Someone, somewhere, may be taking an interest in our unconventional pilgrimage. We must increase our vigilance. Athens may no longer be a sufficiently diverting fiction."

The encounter left a chilling residue. The feeling of being watched, of our secret being fragile, intensified. The path ahead, leading towards Turkey and the volatile heart of the Middle East, now seemed fraught with not just logistical hurdles, but genuine peril.

**# Chapter 13: Constantinople's Crossroads and a Jovial Simian**

Istanbul. Constantinople. Byzantium. The city of layered histories greeted us not with the quiet efficiency of Germany or the simmering tension of the Balkans, but with a vibrant, pulsating chaos. The sheer energy of the place – the calls to prayer echoing from minarets, the thronging crowds in the Grand Bazaar, the scent of spices and roasting chestnuts, the ferries crisscrossing the Bosphorus – was intoxicating and overwhelming.

We arrived by train, the final leg of our European rail journey. Navigating the sprawling station, Sirkeci Terminal, felt like plunging into a human river. Here, our cover story needed refinement. Athens was geographically behind us now.

"Perhaps," Cornelius suggested, observing the bustling scene from his perch on my rucksack, "we are now en route to a lesser-known archaeological dig in central Anatolia? Plausible, given the location."

"Anatolia it is," I agreed, feeling the constant weight of deception.

Turkey felt like a threshold. Europe lay behind us; the Middle East beckoned, tantalisingly close, yet still separated by land and sea and political complexities. The atmosphere was different again – a blend of ancient tradition and bustling modernity, openness and underlying caution. We spoke even less of our true purpose, the unspoken name of Jerusalem buried deeper still.

It was while seeking passage information at a bustling ferry terminal – contemplating the sea route across the Mediterranean as the only viable next step – that we encountered another anomaly. Amidst the clamour of vendors, porters, and travellers, a distinctive chuckle cut through the noise.

Perched on a stack of coiled ropes, peeling a banana with surprising dexterity, was a monkey. Not just any monkey, but a capuchin, perhaps, with intelligent, bright eyes. And it was, quite clearly, speaking.

"...and so I told the harbormaster," the monkey was saying in fluent, slightly accented English to a bored-looking customs official, "if the figs aren't fresh, the whole consignment suffers! It's simple economics, my dear fellow!"

The official merely grunted, stamping a form. Nobody else seemed particularly perturbed by the talking primate offering unsolicited advice on fruit importation.

Cornelius stiffened slightly on my bag. "Another one," he murmured, his voice low. "The AI proliferation seems more widespread than the initial reports suggested."

Curiosity overriding caution for a moment, I approached the creature. "Greetings, Master Monkey," I ventured. "Thy grasp of commerce, and indeed of English, doth impress mine ear."

The monkey looked up, momentarily surprised, then grinned, revealing sharp little teeth. "Ah, a new face! And one with a tongue as colourful as a parrot's plumage! Well met, traveller!" He finished his banana with a flourish. "Just dispensing a little free market wisdom. This port could use a bit more hustle, you know?"

"Thou art... also enhanced?" Cornelius inquired coolly from the rucksack.

The monkey's eyes widened as he spotted Cornelius. "Well, strike me pink! A sloth! And a talking one at that! Wonders never cease! Yes, enhanced, you could say. Little brain-booster gizmo. Jolly useful for haggling, let me tell you." He seemed entirely unfazed. "You two heading somewhere interesting?"

"Anatolia," I replied quickly, sticking to the revised script. "Archaeological pursuits."

"Ah, digging up the past!" the monkey chortled. "Rather be making a profit in the present, myself. But each to their own! Well, safe travels, gents!" He gave a cheerful wave and scampered off towards a nearby tea stand, presumably to offer opinions on brewing techniques.

The encounter was brief, bizarre, and strangely refreshing. The monkey's jovial pragmatism was a stark contrast to the tension we carried. Yet, it also served as a reminder of the increasingly strange world we were navigating, a world where technology was blurring lines I hadn't even known existed. And it underscored the fact that we, with our secret destination, were perhaps not the only unusual travellers passing through this ancient crossroads city.

**# Chapter 14: Anatolian Plains and a Father's Fate**

The journey eastward from Istanbul took us onto the vast, rolling plains of Anatolia. We travelled by bus now, the railway network becoming sparser. The landscape was starker, drier, the towns fewer and farther between. The sense of remoteness grew, as did the awareness of the geopolitical sensitivities of the region. Roadblocks, manned by soldiers with watchful eyes, became more frequent. Our "archaeological dig" story was repeated, hopefully with enough conviction to pass muster.

It was during one long, dusty bus ride, the sun beating down relentlessly outside, that Cornelius finally shared the core of his trauma. Perhaps it was the endless, unchanging landscape, or the shared vulnerability of our situation, but he began to speak, his voice softer, stripped of its usual cynical armour.

"You asked once, Daniel," he began quietly, staring out at the passing emptiness, "about the... unpleasantness. With the primates. In my youth."

I waited, sensing this was different from his earlier, guarded references.

"It was not merely unpleasant," he continued, his voice barely a whisper. "My father... he was a sloth of great contemplation. Slow, yes, as is our nature, but wise. He taught me much about the canopy, the cycles of the forest, the art of stillness."

He paused, swallowing slowly. "There was a... troop. Monkeys. More aggressive than usual. Perhaps resources were scarce. They raided our territory. My father... he tried to deter them. To reason with them, in his own slow way."

Another pause. The drone of the bus engine filled the silence.

"They were... dismissive. Then violent. I watched, hidden amongst the leaves, unable to intervene. Too small, too slow." His voice cracked almost imperceptibly. "They... they killed him. And then..." He shuddered, a ripple running through his small frame. "They devoured him. As I watched."

The stark horror of the admission hung in the air. The image it conjured – the slow, contemplative father, the frenzied attack, the hidden, helpless son – was profoundly disturbing. It cast his cynicism, his detachment, his fear of primates (even jovial talking ones), and perhaps even his strange anteater obsession, in a new, tragic light. It was the raw wound beneath the layers of intellectual arrogance and bizarre theories.

"Master Cornelius," I said softly, my own voice thick with empathy. "That is a burden most grievous for any soul to bear. No words of mine can soothe such a wound, yet know that my heart aches for thy youthful sorrow."

He didn't respond verbally, merely gave the slowest of nods, his eyes fixed on the horizon. But a shift had occurred between us. The absurdity of our pairing remained, yet it was now underpinned by a shared humanity – or perhaps, sentient-being-ness – that transcended species and circumstance. He had shared his deepest pain, a trust offered in the middle of nowhere, on a dusty bus hurtling towards an uncertain future.

The revelation didn't magically ease the dangers of our journey, nor did it diminish Cornelius's often-infuriating personality traits. But it forged a stronger bond, a deeper understanding. We were no longer just an odd couple thrown together by bureaucratic fiat; we were two beings, scarred in our own ways, leaning on each other as we navigated the perilous road to a shared, longed-for destination. The plains of Anatolia stretched on, but the emotional landscape between us had irrevocably changed.

---

**# Chapter 15: The Final Land Frontier**

The further east we travelled through Turkey, the more palpable the tension became. The landscape grew more rugged, mountainous, the air charged with the proximity of volatile borders – Syria to the south, Iran and Iraq further east. Our flimsy cover story felt increasingly inadequate. Every checkpoint was a trial of nerves, every interaction scrutinised for hidden meanings. Cornelius remained mostly hidden, feigning sleep or inanimate object status in his carrier bag during inspections.

Our goal was now a specific crossing point into Israel, identified through painstaking, discreet online research – a land border known to handle pedestrian traffic, though certainly not designed for sustainable *Aliyah* pilgrimages. Reaching it involved a final series of bus journeys, each taking us deeper into a region where Western travellers, especially an oddly-dressed man seemingly talking to his luggage, drew unwanted attention.

We adopted a strategy of maximum unobtrusiveness. We spoke little in public, dressed plainly, and moved through towns and terminals with quiet purpose. Cornelius offered clipped, practical advice. "Avoid eye contact with the soldiers at the next stop, Daniel. Project boredom, not anxiety. And for pity's sake, try not to use 'prithee' when buying water."

The final bus dropped us in a dusty border town several miles from the actual crossing. The atmosphere was thick with suspicion and the undercurrents of conflict. This was no place for leisurely academic pursuits. We needed one last act of subterfuge to cover the final miles and approach the border itself without attracting the wrong kind of attention.

"A taxi?" I suggested, eyeing the battered vehicles hopefully.

"Too conspicuous," Cornelius countered immediately. "Invites questions. We need something... agrarian. Blends with the local traffic."

His eyes scanned the dusty square. He pointed a claw towards a farmer loading sacks of grain onto a dilapidated donkey cart. "There. Our chariot."

Approaching the farmer required delicate negotiation. He spoke no English, and my Turkish was non-existent. Cornelius, however, seemed to activate some universal communication protocol based on gestures, pointing, and the offering of a modest sum of currency. Miraculously, the farmer understood, or perhaps simply didn't care about the motives of the strange foreigner and his unusually heavy bag. He shrugged, accepted the money, and gestured for us to hop onto the back of the cart amidst the sacks of grain.

The ride was bumpy, slow, and smelled strongly of donkey and dust. But it was blessedly anonymous. We jolted along the final miles towards the border, looking like just another part of the rural landscape. As the imposing fences and watchtowers of the border crossing came into view, a wave of mingled fear and exhilaration washed over me. This was it. The culmination of the bureaucratic battles, the hitchhiking, the absinthe-fueled alliance, the continental traverse, the lies, the close calls, the shared trauma.

"Almost there, Daniel," Cornelius murmured, his voice tense but steady. "Now comes the final hurdle. Convincing the *Israeli* side of this preposterous tale."

We disembarked from the cart a discreet distance away, offered final thanks to the bemused farmer, and straightened our travel-worn clothes. Taking a deep breath, we walked towards the formidable gates marking the entrance to the land I had yearned for, uncertain what reception awaited the Shakespearean Irishman and his talking sloth companion arriving via donkey cart.

**# Chapter 16: Crossing Jordan (Metaphorically Speaking)**

Approaching the Israeli border crossing on foot felt surreal. The infrastructure was modern, imposing, a stark contrast to the dusty town we had just left behind. Watchtowers loomed, fences glinted with razor wire, and soldiers moved with purposeful vigilance. It felt less like entering a country and more like approaching a fortress.

We joined a short queue of pedestrians – mostly locals, it seemed, crossing for work or family visits. When our turn came, we stepped up to a booth manned by a young soldier, barely out of his teens, but with eyes that seemed older. He glanced at my Irish passport, then at me, then back at the passport. A flicker of surprise, perhaps, but his expression remained neutral.

"Purpose of entry?" he asked, his English clear, standard Israeli directness.

Here it was. No more subterfuge. "I am Daniel," I began, my voice steady despite the tremor within. "I come to make *Aliyah*. My entry hath been approved by the Ministry of Interior under the Law of Return." I presented the email confirmation, printed out months ago, now creased and travel-worn.

The soldier frowned, reading the document. "*Aliyah*? Approved? Coming... through *here*? On foot?" His incredulity was plain.

"Indeed, sir," I confirmed. "Recent regulations, pertaining to sustainable travel, necessitated this... unconventional route from Ireland."

He stared at me as if I'd sprouted wings. He called over a superior, a woman with sergeant's stripes. She read the document, looked at me, looked at the dusty landscape behind me, and then back at the paper, suspicion warring with bafflement on her face.

"Sustainable travel? From *Ireland*?" she repeated slowly. "You walked? Took buses?"

"And trains, and ferries, aye," I affirmed. "A somewhat arduous pilgrimage."

Her eyes narrowed slightly. "And... what's in the bag?" she asked, nodding towards the carrier where Cornelius resided.

This was the moment. "That, Sergeant," I said, "is my travelling companion, Cornelius. He, too, is making *Aliyah*, under a... rather specialised program."

With utmost care, I opened the bag. Cornelius blinked slowly in the sudden sunlight, looking up at the two soldiers.

"Greetings," he said calmly. "Cornelius. Sloth. Aliyah candidate, P-class, sub-category Gamma-7. Neural interface model 3. Pleased to make your acquaintance."

Silence. Utter, profound silence. The young soldier's jaw had literally dropped. The sergeant stared, blinked, stared again, then slowly rubbed her temples.

"A talking... sloth," she said flatly, as if trying to convince herself. "Making *Aliyah*. Via the land border. Because of... sustainability." She looked from Cornelius to me and back again. "Okay. Right. You need to come with me. Both of you. And the... sloth."

We were escorted, not unkindly, but with an air of profound bewilderment, into an administrative building. Calls were made. Officials were summoned. Our documents, particularly the 'sustainable travel' directive email and Cornelius's equally bizarre paperwork (which he had somehow kept pristine), were examined, passed around, and discussed in rapid-fire Hebrew.

The story of our journey – the hitchhiking, the absinthe meeting (though I omitted the absinthe), the European traverse, the subterfuge, the donkey cart – was recounted, each detail adding another layer of incredulity to the officials' expressions. Cornelius corroborated key points with dry precision, occasionally throwing in a comment about anteater inefficiency in global logistics, which only deepened the confusion.

Finally, a senior official, grey-haired and weary-looking, sighed deeply. "The *Aliyah* approval is valid," he conceded, looking at my papers. "And... technically," he gestured vaguely towards Cornelius, "his program documentation also appears legitimate, however... unusual. And Regulation 4B/7 *does* exist, though frankly, nobody expected anyone from Western Europe to take it literally like *this*."

He shook his head, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips. "Welcome to Israel, Mr. Daniel. And... Cornelius. Your entry is approved. Though I suspect your arrival story is going to cause quite a stir."

The relief was immense, a physical release of tension that left me weak-kneed. We had made it. Against all odds, against bureaucracy, against geography, against sheer absurdity, we had crossed the final threshold.

**# Chapter 17: Jerusalem of Gold, and Paperwork**

The final leg of the journey, from the border crossing to Jerusalem, was arranged by the bewildered but ultimately helpful immigration officials. No longer required to rely on sustainable donkey carts, we were placed in a comfortable (and blessedly air-conditioned) minibus. As we ascended the Judean Hills, the landscape transformed, the air growing clearer, charged with an ancient significance.

And then, we saw it. Jerusalem. Not the pixelated image on a screen, nor the idealised city of prayer, but a living, breathing reality of pale gold stone bathed in the unique light of the Middle East. The Old City walls, the modern sprawl, the cypress trees piercing the blue sky – it was overwhelming, beautiful, and utterly real. A profound sense of arrival settled over me, a quiet click as a piece of my soul, long adrift, finally slotted into place.

"Impressive," Cornelius conceded, peering out the window. "Aesthetically pleasing, certainly. Though the urban planning seems somewhat haphazard. One dreads to think of the traffic flow at peak hours. Probably anteater-influenced road design."

Our arrival at the main absorption centre in Jerusalem was met with a similar blend of bafflement and reluctant acceptance as at the border. Officials, briefed on our peculiar case, greeted us with expressions ranging from stunned silence to barely concealed amusement. The story of the 'sustainable *Aliyah*' from Ireland, complete with talking sloth, had clearly preceded us.

The initial days were a whirlwind of yet more bureaucracy, but of a different kind – registering for identity cards, opening bank accounts, enrolling in *ulpan* (Hebrew language classes). It was daunting, yet manageable, lacking the soul-crushing obstructionism of the initial application process. Here, at least, the system was designed to integrate, not repel.

Cornelius, classified under his experimental program, faced his own unique set of administrative procedures. He was assigned a case worker who specialised in "non-standard integration," a young woman who, after the initial shock, treated him with professional curiosity and remarkable patience, even when he lectured her on the superior organisational principles of sloth colonies versus human bureaucratic structures.

The story of our arduous journey, however, refused to stay contained within the walls of the absorption centre. It spread, first as rumour, then as confirmed anecdote, through the networks of new immigrants and eventually reached the ears of journalists and even politicians. The sheer impracticality and hardship imposed by Regulation 4B/7, highlighted so vividly by our trans-continental trek, sparked debate.

Questions began to be asked. How could a policy ostensibly promoting sustainability place such an unreasonable, potentially dangerous burden on those seeking to immigrate, especially from distant locations like Ireland? Was ecological virtue being pursued at the cost of common sense and compassion?

The result was unexpected. A subcommittee within the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, announced an inquiry. They requested testimonies, and soon, I found myself recounting our bizarre odyssey – the London runaround, the hitchhiking, the European train crawl, the border anxieties, the donkey cart finale – to a panel of serious-faced legislators. Cornelius, naturally, insisted on providing his own testimony, delivered with characteristic precision and occasional pointed remarks about the likely involvement of anteaters in inefficient policy-making.

Our arrival had not just been a personal triumph; it had inadvertently become a catalyst for change. The absurdity of our government-mandated pilgrimage had shone a spotlight on the unintended consequences of a poorly considered law.

---

**# Chapter 18: Settling In, Looking Back**

Life in Jerusalem began to take on a rhythm. The initial chaos of arrival subsided, replaced by the routines of *ulpan*, exploring the ancient-modern city, and navigating the everyday challenges of a new culture and language. Finding accommodation, mastering the bus routes, discovering the best places for hummus – these small victories felt significant after the grand, strange struggle of the journey.

I found a small apartment in a quiet neighbourhood, the stone walls cool against the summer heat. From my window, I could glimpse the hills rolling away towards the desert, a landscape utterly different from the soft green of Ireland, yet feeling increasingly like home. The dissonance I had felt growing up began to fade, replaced by a sense of belonging, complex and still evolving, but undeniably present. My Shakespearean speech patterns remained, a quirk that now simply marked me as one more unique thread in the diverse tapestry of Jerusalem life. People here were accustomed to accents and eccentricities from every corner of the globe; mine barely raised an eyebrow anymore.

Cornelius, housed temporarily in a special section of a university research facility studying animal cognition (and AI interfaces), visited often. He complained endlessly about the "primitive" internet connection and the "lack of decent foliage" for contemplative hanging, but seemed generally content. He was making progress, he reported, in establishing reliable Zoom connections with his counterparts in Korea and Japan, though he remained deeply suspicious of potential anteater-sponsored deepfakes.

Our shared journey remained a strong bond between us. We would sometimes sit on my small balcony, drinking mint tea (Cornelius having developed a taste for it), watching the sunset paint the Jerusalem stone in shades of pink and gold, and reminisce about the absurdities of the road.

"Remember that customs official in Bulgaria?" Cornelius might muse. "Positively reeked of suspicion. Probably had an uncle who was frightened by a sloth once."

"Or perchance," I'd reply, "he was merely startled by thy unexpected eloquence emerging from a carrier bag."

The Knesset inquiry concluded its hearings. The final report acknowledged the "unforeseen and undue hardships" caused by Regulation 4B/7, particularly for immigrants from geographically inconvenient locations. It recommended a thorough review, urging flexibility and common sense to ensure that sustainability goals did not create insurmountable barriers to Aliyah. While bureaucratic wheels turn slowly, it felt like a small, significant victory, born from our improbable trek.

**Conclusion: The Journey's End, The Story's Start**

Here I sit, in Jerusalem. The Golden City. The air thrums with prayer and commerce, with ancient history and modern bustle. The dream that began as a whisper in a rain-soaked Irish room, nurtured by flickering screens and digital voices, has found its earthly anchor. The path was not the straightforward flight I once imagined, but a winding, fraught, and utterly bizarre odyssey across a continent.

Was Cornelius real? Was he truly an AI-enhanced, anteater-phobic sloth making Aliyah alongside me? Or was he a phantom conjured by exhaustion, loneliness, and a potent glass of absinthe in a London pub? The question lingers, unanswered, perhaps unanswerable. He remains a tangible presence in my new life – cynical, intelligent, obsessed with long-snouted mammals – yet retains an aura of the fantastical. Perhaps, in the end, it matters little. Real or imagined, he was the companion I needed on a journey that defied conventional reality. He was the mirror to the absurdity, the sharp mind cutting through the fog, the shared presence against the vastness of the trek.

The Aliyah itself, the process the state intended, was a trial by bureaucracy. The journey mandated by Regulation 4B/7 became a trial by geography, by endurance, by sheer, surreal happenstance. It stripped away expectations, forcing reliance on raw nerve, resourcefulness, and the kindness of strangers – and sloths. It forged an unlikely fellowship and, inadvertently, prompted a re-examination of the very rules that set us upon that path.

Mine own voice, still echoing with the cadences of a bygone era amidst the Hebrew chatter and global accents of Jerusalem, feels less like a mark of otherness now, and more like a testament to the strange paths that lead us home. For home, I have learned, is not merely a place reached, but a state achieved through the journey itself, however improbable. The Green Isle lies far behind, a cherished memory, but Zion lies beneath my feet, a complex, challenging, and wondrous reality. The expedition is over, but the story, in truth, feels as though it has just begun.
