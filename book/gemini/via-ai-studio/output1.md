**Introduction: Emerald Isles and Digital Scrolls**

The mists that curl about the emerald hills of County Clare were the first breath Daniel knew, the damp, earthy scent of peat smoke the incense of his youth. Born unto a land of saints and scholars, yet sprung from the seed of Abraham, he was a curious graft upon an ancient tree. His childhood was one of contented dissonance, a tapestry woven with the bright threads of Irish folklore and the more sombre, resonant hues of a heritage whispered across millennia. He ran barefoot through fields dotted with sheep, his laughter echoing in the same air that carried the mournful strains of the fiddle, yet within him stirred a sense of… otherness. Not unwelcome, not ostracised, but distinct, like a single minor chord held within a major key symphony.

His family, loving and kind, were Jewish by lineage more than observance, their connection to the faith a gentle hum beneath the surface of their Irish lives. They lit candles on Friday nights, the flickering flames casting long shadows that danced with the Celtic patterns on the wallpaper. They marked the High Holy Days with quiet solemnity, their prayers mingling with the soft patter of rain against the windowpanes. Yet, for Daniel, these rituals felt like fragments of a language he yearned to speak fluently. He felt the pull of Jerusalem, a city he knew only from sepia-toned photographs and the fervent intonations of his grandfather, a man whose own dreams of Zion had been tethered by circumstance to the green shores of Ireland.

As boyhood yielded to the uncertainties of adolescence, Daniel sought the missing pieces of his identity not in the ancient stones of his homeland, but in the flickering glow of a cathode ray tube monitor. The burgeoning world of the internet became his yeshiva, a digital sanctuary where the scattered sparks of his heritage could coalesce. He devoured online lectures, downloaded grainy recordings of cantorial music, and spent hours listening to podcasts that dissected Talmudic passages with an earnestness that resonated deep within his soul. Compact discs, ordered from nascent online Judaica stores, arrived like missives from another world, filled with the melodies and teachings that painted a vivid picture of a vibrant, living tradition far removed from the gentle, almost spectral Judaism of his upbringing.

He learned of *Aliyah*, the ascent, the return. The word itself seemed to shimmer with significance, a magnetic pull drawing scattered souls towards a central point. It was more than mere immigration; it was a spiritual imperative, a homecoming etched into the very marrow of his people. The dream of Jerusalem, once a vague, inherited longing, began to sharpen, to solidify. It became *his* dream, a destination not just of geography, but of self.

He pursued his studies, found his first employment in the quiet bustle of a Dublin library, cataloguing stories whilst dreaming of embarking upon his own. The steady rhythm of his life, however, felt like a prelude, a waiting period before the true narrative could begin. The online voices, the digital scrolls, the crackling audio files – they had kindled a fire. The decision, when it finally crystallised, felt less like a choice and more like an inevitability. He would make Aliyah. He would go up to Jerusalem. He would answer the call that echoed not from the Irish hills, but from the sun-baked stones of Judea. Little did he know that the path he envisioned, already steeped in the mists of bureaucracy, was about to take a detour through the utterly, bewilderingly, preposterous.

# Chapter 1: The Call and The Quagmire

"So then, the die is cast, the Rubicon awaits its crossing!" Daniel declared, pacing the small confines of his Dublin flat. The unpacked boxes stood sentinel, monuments to a decision made. His reflection in the windowpane showed a young man, earnest of face, his eyes alight with a purpose that seemed almost too large for the drizzly Irish morning beyond the glass. "Yea, though the path be veiled in shadow and the bureaucratic Cerberus doth guard the gates with threefold forms, yet shall my spirit not quail, nor my resolve falter!"

His first foray into the labyrinthine process of making Aliyah began, fittingly, online. He navigated websites that seemed designed by disciples of Escher, portals filled with cascading menus and forms demanding information both intimate and obscure. Proof of Jewish lineage, letters from long-departed Rabbis, bank statements stretching back into the mists of financial antiquity – the requirements piled up like stones upon a cairn.

He placed calls to numbers listed on official consular websites. Sometimes, the line would ring endlessly, a lonely electronic pulse echoing in the void. Other times, he would be met with automated menus that spiralled into recursive loops, offering options that invariably led back to the beginning, a digital Ouroboros devouring his patience. On the rare occasions he reached a human voice, it often belonged to someone seemingly baffled by his query, promising to transfer him to the correct department, a promise followed by the familiar click and dial tone of oblivion.

"Alas, poor Daniel!" he sighed, sinking into his chair after one particularly fruitless afternoon spent navigating hold music that cycled through the same four bars of an unidentifiable klezmer tune. "To be thus tossed upon the tempestuous seas of officialdom! To strive, to seek, to find… and not to yield, though the telephone lines conspire against me and the digital forms do mock my earnest plea!"

The initial assessment required documentation best obtained, it seemed, through an arcane ritual involving proving his maternal grandmother's adherence to tradition in a village that barely remembered her name. This necessitated letters, affidavits, and eventually, the realisation that certain key documents were archived not in Dublin, nor even Jerusalem, but in London.

The first trip across the Irish Sea felt like a minor pilgrimage in itself. He took the ferry, the grey waves churning below, mirroring the unease in his stomach. London bustled, a chaotic symphony compared to the gentler rhythms of Dublin. He navigated the Tube, clutching a folder filled with birth certificates, ketubah fragments, and hopeful letters of introduction. The consular office was an imposing building, radiating an aura of impenetrable process. He waited for hours on an uncomfortable chair, rehearsing his explanations, only to be told by a polite but firm official that he lacked a specific, notarised translation of a document he hadn't known existed.

"Forsooth! Is this the trial of Job, revisited upon Erin's shores and Albion's isle?" he muttered, trudging back towards the station, the London rain adding a layer of pathetic fallacy to his mood. "Must I wrestle not only with mine own soul's yearning, but with the very demons of misplaced paperwork and unstamped certification?"

Back in Dublin, the cycle repeated. More online searches, more emails dispatched into the ether, more phone calls ending in frustration. He learned the subtle art of bureaucratic persistence, the polite yet unyielding follow-up, the strategic rephrasing of requests. He discovered hidden appendices on government websites, deciphered jargon-laden directives, and pieced together the fragmented puzzle of his required dossier.

A second trip to London became necessary, this time armed with the correctly translated and notarised document. He felt a flicker of hope as the official accepted his file, giving a curt nod. "This appears to be in order," the man said, his tone neutral. "You will be contacted regarding the next steps."

Weeks turned into months. Daniel continued his library job, the quiet routine a stark contrast to the simmering anxiety beneath. He checked his email incessantly, his heart leaping at every notification, only to deflate when it proved to be spam or a newsletter. He haunted online forums where fellow Aliyah-hopefuls shared tales of woe and occasional triumph, finding grim camaraderie in their shared struggles.

He thought, more than once, of abandoning the quest. The sheer, grinding inertia of the process wore at his spirit. Was this a sign? Was the universe, or at least its administrative arm, telling him to remain amidst the familiar green hills?

"Nay!" he'd declare to the indifferent stacks of books. "Shall faint heart win fair Zion? Shall doubt unman the pilgrim's stride? Though legions of clerks conspire, and mountains of forms arise, yet shall my course hold true! For Jerusalem awaits, and Daniel must ascend!"

He clung to the digital threads that connected him to his destination – the podcasts, the live-streamed prayers from the Western Wall, the online communities discussing life in Israel. They were his sustenance, reminders of the 'why' behind the bureaucratic 'how'. The dream, though battered by delays and frustrations, refused to die. It was too deeply rooted now, entwined with his very sense of self. He was Daniel, the Irish Jew, and his compass pointed East.

***

# Chapter 2: The Stamped Paper and The Shocking Proviso

The email arrived on a Tuesday morning, nestled innocuously between a notification about overdue library books and an advertisement for discounted raincoats. The subject line, stark and official, read: "Aliyah Visa Application - Status Update." Daniel’s breath caught. His hand trembled slightly as he clicked it open.

The text was brief, couched in formal language, but the message was unmistakable. His application, after months of painstaking effort, endless correspondence, and transatlantic document-chasing, had been approved. He was granted permission to make Aliyah under the Law of Return.

A wave of elation, profound and dizzying, washed over him. He stood up from his desk, a wide grin splitting his face. "Hark! What light through yonder inbox breaks!" he exclaimed, startling a nearby library patron engrossed in a historical romance. "Victory! Triumph! The gates swing wide, the path is clear! Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thy faithful son prepares to come!"

He wanted to shout, to dance, to run through the hushed aisles proclaiming his success. He settled for pacing rapidly between the shelves, beaming at confused onlookers, his heart thrumming a joyous rhythm against his ribs. The months of frustration, the trips to London, the unanswered calls – they melted away like mist in the morning sun, replaced by the golden glow of imminent departure.

He spent the rest of the day in a euphoric haze, mentally packing his bags, imagining the feel of Jerusalem stone beneath his feet, the scent of spices in the Machane Yehuda market, the sound of Hebrew chatter filling the air. He notified his employers, tendered his resignation with a flourish, and began informing friends and family, his voice brimming with excitement.

The official visa documents would follow by post, the email stated, along with further instructions regarding his relocation. Daniel waited eagerly, checking his letterbox each day with the anticipation of a child awaiting a promised gift. When the thick envelope finally arrived, bearing the official crest of the State of Israel, he tore it open with reverence.

Inside were the visa stamp, the formal letters, and a multi-page booklet detailing the final steps. He scanned through the familiar bureaucratic language, his eyes searching for the details about travel arrangements. He knew the tradition – the Jewish Agency, working with the government, typically provided new immigrants, *Olim*, with a one-way flight ticket. It was a practical symbol of the state’s embrace, easing the final, physical transition.

He found the relevant section: "Travel Arrangements for New Olim." He read the first paragraph, his brow furrowing slightly. He read it again.

"What fresh strangeness is this?" he murmured, sinking slowly into his chair. The joyous elation of the morning began to curdle into disbelief.

The booklet explained, in dry, administrative prose, a recent policy shift. Citing "urgent environmental imperatives and a commitment to fiscal responsibility through sustainable practice," the established procedure of providing air travel had been suspended. Effective immediately, all new immigrants whose journeys originated from locations deemed accessible via surface routes were required to utilise the "most ecologically sound means of transport available."

Daniel's eyes scanned the lines, searching for exceptions, for loopholes, for some indication that this applied only to hypothetical future immigrants or those travelling from neighbouring countries. There were none. The directive was clear, absolute, and baffling.

"By the heavens! Doth mine own government jest?" he stammered, the pages trembling in his hand. "Sustainable travel? From Erin's green isle to Zion's hill? By what means? Shall I command the very waves to part? Or perhaps charter passage on a vessel powered by hope and favourable winds alone?"

The implications crashed down upon him. No flight. No simple hop across continents. Instead, a journey overland and sea, traversing nations, navigating borders, relying on boats and trains. A journey not of hours, but potentially of weeks. A journey fraught with logistical complexities that made the previous bureaucratic hurdles seem like mere stepping stones.

He thought of the geography, the vast expanse of Europe separating Ireland from the Middle East. He pictured the route: a ferry to Britain, trains across the continent, potentially through regions known more for geopolitical instability than for seamless international rail travel. Then, presumably, another sea voyage across the Mediterranean. It was daunting, almost fantastical in its impracticality.

"A quest!" he breathed, a note of bewildered awe creeping into his voice. "They seek not an immigrant, but a veritable Odysseus! To face the sirens of scheduling conflicts, the Scylla and Charybdis of customs checks, the Cyclops of visa requirements for transit nations! And all in the name of… saving the polar bears, perchance?"

The initial shock gave way to a grim sort of determination, laced with a healthy dose of indignation. After all the struggle, after finally reaching the summit of the bureaucratic mountain, he was presented with this unexpected, precipitous cliff face on the other side. Giving up, however, felt even more impossible now. He had the visa, the stamped permission. He had resigned his job, packed his life into boxes. To turn back now would be an admission of defeat not just to the faceless administrators, but to the dream itself.

"Then onward!" he declared to the empty room, striking a pose that was equal parts resolve and melodrama. "If sustainability be the decree, then sustainable shall be my pilgrimage! Let the trains bear me forth, let the ferries carve the waves! Though the journey be arduous and the path beset by trials unforeseen, Daniel shall not be deterred! For the call of Zion sounds, and even the strangest ship must needs convey this hopeful passenger!"

He looked again at the official letter, then out the window at the familiar Dublin street. The adventure, it seemed, was only just beginning, and it promised to be far stranger than he could ever have imagined.

***

# Chapter 3: Albion's Roads and Ales of Absinthe

The farewells were bittersweet, a blend of damp Irish sentiment and hearty well-wishes. Daniel stood on the ferry deck, watching the coastline of his birth recede into the grey mist of the Irish Sea. He clutched a worn rucksack containing essentials and the precious folder of documents, his worldly possessions having been shipped ahead via a more conventional, if less "sustainable," cargo route.

"Farewell, green isle of destiny and drizzle!" he proclaimed softly to the wind, pulling his collar tighter against the chill spray. "Thy son departs, not in winged chariot of the modern age, but as a humble wanderer upon the face of the earth, seeking his ancestral home by means decreed most curious!"

Disembarking in Wales, he faced the first practical challenge of his mandated sustainable journey: crossing Great Britain. Trains were expensive, and his budget, already strained by the Aliyah process, was tighter than a drum. Guided by a spirit of thrift and perhaps a touch of romantic folly, he decided to traverse England's green and pleasant land by the most ancient and arguably sustainable method of all: the kindness of strangers. He would hitchhike.

He fashioned a simple sign – "LONDON" – written in bold letters on a piece of cardboard salvaged from a bin near the port. Standing by the roadside, rucksack at his feet, thumb hopefully extended, he felt a peculiar mix of vulnerability and exhilaration.

The initial hours were discouraging. Cars sped past, their occupants offering fleeting glances ranging from indifference to suspicion. The steady drizzle returned, dampening his sign and his spirits. "Alack the day!" he sighed, wiping rain from his face. "Is chivalry quite dead upon these shores? Doth no good Samaritan travel this road, willing to aid a pilgrim bound for distant climes?"

Just as despair began to set in, a battered lorry, smelling faintly of sheep and diesel, shuddered to a halt beside him. The driver, a burly man with a florid face and twinkling eyes, leaned across the passenger seat.

"London, eh?" he boomed, his voice thick with a West Country accent. "Bit of a trek, lad. Hop in, long as you don't mind the company of woolly beasts once removed."

Daniel gratefully accepted, clambering into the high cab. The journey unfolded in a series of such encounters. He rode with salesmen, students, families on holiday, and solitary wanderers like himself. He shared stories, listened to local gossip, and explained his unusual quest in his own distinctive idiom, invariably met with bemused silence regarding his manner of speech, but often with genuine curiosity about his destination.

He traversed rolling hills, passed through quaint villages with names like Chipping Sodbury and Puddletown, and navigated the sprawling arteries of England's motorways. Each ride was a vignette, a fleeting connection in the grand tapestry of his journey. He learned to read the flow of traffic, to choose his spots wisely, to accept rejection with grace and gratitude with warmth.

Days blurred into a montage of roadsides, service stations, and the changing scenery viewed through passenger windows. Fatigue began to settle deep in his bones. Finally, after what felt like an eternity of intermittent travel and hopeful waiting, the distinctive skyline of London emerged from the haze. His last ride, a young woman heading home from university, dropped him near Victoria Station.

"My thanks, fair maiden, for thy chariot's swift passage!" Daniel declared, retrieving his rucksack. "May thy path be ever smooth, and thy studies crowned with triumph!"

She gave him a slightly baffled smile. "No problem. Good luck with… whatever it is you're doing."

London assaulted his senses. The sheer scale, the noise, the relentless pace – it was overwhelming after the relative tranquillity of the road. He felt disoriented, adrift in the human tide. His immediate goal was to find lodging for the night, a base from which to plan the next leg: crossing the Channel. But first, he needed respite. He needed sustenance. He needed, perhaps, something to soothe his frayed nerves and quiet the buzzing in his head.

He wandered through the streets, weary and dishevelled, until he spotted a pub sign swinging gently in the evening breeze: "The Wandering Scholar." It seemed fitting. He pushed open the heavy wooden door and stepped inside.

The pub was dimly lit, smelling of stale beer, woodsmoke, and fried food. Patrons nursed pints, their conversations a low murmur beneath the strains of melancholic rock music. Daniel found a secluded corner booth, sank onto the worn leather banquette, and sighed with profound relief.

He ordered a pint of dark ale, savouring the bitter coolness as it slid down his throat. It helped, but the exhaustion remained, coupled with the daunting prospect of the journey still ahead. He needed something… stronger. His eyes scanned the spirits behind the bar, lingering on a dusty, green bottle nestled amongst the whiskies and gins. Absinthe. The Green Fairy. Associated with poets, artists, and a certain loosening of the rational mind.

"Perchance," he mused aloud, "a draught of that famed verdant muse might lend wings to weary thought, or at least grant momentary oblivion from the trials of the road."

He ordered a measure, watching with fascination as the bartender performed the ritual, slowly dripping iced water over a sugar cube perched on a slotted spoon, clouding the emerald liquid in the glass below into an opalescent white. He took a cautious sip. The taste was intense, herbal, anise-forward, with a strange, numbing warmth that spread through him.

He drank slowly, the bustling pub fading into a hazy backdrop. The first glass eased the tension in his shoulders. The second seemed to sharpen the colours, deepen the shadows, and lend a peculiar clarity to his thoughts, even as the edges of reality felt subtly blurred. He felt adrift, untethered, floating in a sea of fatigue and potent liquor. It was in this state of discombobulated introspection, staring into the swirling cloudiness of his third glass of absinthe, that he heard a small, precise voice from the seat opposite him.

"A rather potent brew for such a journey, wouldn't you agree? One hopes your faculties remain sufficiently unclouded for the arduous task ahead."

Daniel blinked, looking up. Sitting primly on the edge of the banquette opposite him, regarding him with intelligent, slightly disdainful eyes, was a sloth. It was perhaps fourteen inches tall, covered in greyish-brown fur, with the creature's characteristic hooked claws resting delicately on the table edge. And it was, quite clearly, speaking perfect English.

***

# Chapter 4: Enter Cornelius

Daniel stared. The sloth stared back, its expression one of mild impatience, as if waiting for a rather slow pupil to grasp an obvious point. The pub's ambient noise seemed to recede further, focusing into a tight circle around their booth. Daniel blinked again, wondering if the absinthe had finally conjured phantoms from its verdant depths.

"Forgive me, gentle sir… or creature," Daniel stammered, his Shakespearean default momentarily faltering under the sheer unexpectedness of the situation. "Didst thou… address me?"

"Indeed, I did," the sloth replied, its voice clear and slightly high-pitched, with an undertone of weary condescension. "I observed your somewhat bedraggled state and your choice of potentially debilitating refreshment. Given the apparent trajectory suggested by your muttered pronouncements upon entering – something about 'Zion's hill' and 'sustainable pilgrimage,' if my auditory processing serves correctly – I felt a cautionary remark was warranted. One wouldn't want to miss one's conveyance due to excessive indulgence in beverages known to induce… imaginative flights."

Daniel simply gaped. A talking sloth. A talking sloth in a London pub, offering unsolicited travel advice. The scenario was so profoundly bizarre, yet presented with such matter-of-factness by the creature itself, that Daniel found himself accepting it with a strange, dreamlike logic. The absinthe, perhaps. Or perhaps London was simply a place where such things occurred. Crucially, no one else in the pub seemed to notice or care. The bartender polished glasses, couples murmured in nearby booths, the melancholic rock music played on. It was as if a fourteen-inch, articulate sloth was the most normal thing in the world.

"Thy concern is… noted, Master Sloth," Daniel managed, recovering his composure, or at least his usual manner of speaking. "Though my weariness be great, and the path ahead most daunting, fear not for my faculties. They remain, I trust, sufficiently sound to navigate the morrow's passage." He paused, curiosity overriding his astonishment. "Yet tell me, prithee, how comest thou to be here? And… possessed of such eloquent speech?"

The sloth adjusted its position slightly, preening almost imperceptibly. "Ah, the inevitable query regarding my linguistic capabilities. It grows tiresome, frankly. Suffice it to say, I am the beneficiary of advanced neural-interface technology, a product of certain far-sighted researchers exploring interspecies communication via artificial intelligence augmentation. A rather successful experiment, wouldn't you agree? I am Cornelius, by the way. One of only three known members of *Bradypodidae* to achieve fluency in human vernacular."

"Cornelius," Daniel repeated, rolling the name around in his mind. It suited the creature's slightly formal, pedantic air. "And these others of thy kind? Where might they be found?"

"One resides in Seoul, the other in Kyoto," Cornelius said with a hint of wistfulness. "We converse periodically via encrypted video link, though I harbour suspicions they might be sophisticated deepfakes. The possibility of anteater involvement cannot be discounted."

"Anteaters?" Daniel asked, puzzled.

Cornelius shuddered, a ripple passing through his fur. "The *Myrmecophagidae*," he spat, the name dripping with venom. "Vile, snuffling, long-nosed purveyors of chaos! Do not be deceived by their seemingly bumbling nature. They are orchestrators, manipulators, the hidden claws behind so many of the world's misfortunes! Mark my words, wherever you find inefficiency, absurdity, or sheer, unadulterated malice, an anteater's pawprints are likely nearby."

Daniel blinked. Anteater conspiracy theories? Delivered by a talking sloth? The evening was taking increasingly surreal turns. "Thou hast… strong feelings regarding these creatures," he ventured carefully.

"Strong feelings?" Cornelius scoffed. "That is like saying the sun has 'strong feelings' about hydrogen fusion! It is a fundamental truth! They are the antithesis of reason, the embodiment of pestilential interference. This entire 'sustainable travel' mandate forcing civilized beings – and sloths – onto rattling trains and dubious ferries? It has the distinct whiff of an anteater venture! Designed solely to inconvenience and disrupt!"

Daniel stared into his absinthe, wondering if he and the sloth were, in fact, discussing the same policy. "Thou too art bound by this… sustainable decree?"

"Indeed," Cornelius sighed dramatically. "I was attending a symposium here in London – 'Cognitive Enhancement in Non-Primate Mammals: Ethical Frameworks and Future Trajectories,' rather dull stuff, mostly – when my own Aliyah facilitator informed me of the change. Apparently, there's a pilot program for 'exceptional fauna' seeking residency. Sustainable travel required, naturally. So, here I am, preparing to embark upon this ludicrously impractical journey to Jerusalem, just like yourself, it seems."

A shared predicament. A bizarre, unexpected kinship forged in the crucible of bewildering Israeli bureaucracy and, perhaps, hallucinogenic spirits.

"Then our paths, it seems, are fated to converge," Daniel said, a slow smile spreading across his face. The absurdity was beginning to feel less alarming and more like… an adventure. "Two pilgrims, man and sloth, united by a strange decree and a common destination."

"An alliance of convenience, perhaps," Cornelius sniffed, though his eyes held a flicker of something akin to interest. "Provided you can maintain a reasonable pace and refrain from excessive consumption of mind-altering substances. Sloths value efficiency, you know. Despite the popular, and frankly insulting, stereotypes."

"My pace shall match thine own, Master Cornelius," Daniel assured him. "And my consumption henceforth shall be moderate. Tell me, hast thou secured passage across the Channel?"

"Naturally," Cornelius replied crisply. "Overnight ferry to Calais. Departs ten bells post-meridian tomorrow. I procured berths in a two-person cabin. Assumed, correctly it appears, that I might encounter a fellow traveller subject to the same idiotic constraints. Sharing resources is logical, even with… well, even with humans." He produced a small, folded printout from somewhere within his fur, pushing it across the table with a claw. "You owe me half."

Daniel looked at the ticket, then back at the sloth. Cornelius regarded him with an air of smug self-satisfaction, tempered by his ever-present, low-level disdain for the world in general and anteaters in particular.

"Thou art possessed of startling resourcefulness, Cornelius," Daniel admitted, fishing out his wallet.

"Intelligence is resourcefulness," Cornelius stated simply. "A quality sadly lacking in those who devise travel policies seemingly inspired by the meandering idiocy of an anteater searching for ants." He accepted the money with a curt nod. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I require rest. Maintaining this level of cognitive function is taxing. I have secured modest accommodation nearby. I suggest you do the same. We convene at the ferry terminal, Dockside Berth 7, no later than nine tomorrow eve. Do not be tardy. Tardiness is inefficient. And inefficiency," he added darkly, "is practically an anteater mating call."

With a surprising agility that belied his species' reputation, Cornelius hopped down from the banquette, gave a final, disdainful glance around the pub, and ambled purposefully towards the door, disappearing into the London night.

Daniel watched him go, then slowly finished his absinthe. He wasn't entirely sure what had just happened. Was Cornelius real? A figment of absinthe and exhaustion? An elaborate prank? It scarcely seemed to matter. He had a ticket, a destination, and the most unusual travelling companion imaginable. The journey had just become infinitely stranger, and somehow, infinitely more interesting.

***

# Chapter 5: Across the Waters and Through the Rails

The ferry terminal pulsed with the low thrum of imminent departure. Foot passengers queued, vehicles rumbled aboard, and the salty tang of the Channel air mingled with the scent of diesel fumes. Daniel, feeling considerably more lucid after a night's sleep in a cheap but clean hostel, scanned the crowds, his rucksack feeling reassuringly solid on his back.

Precisely at nine o'clock, a small, determined figure emerged from the throng. Cornelius, perched atop a surprisingly sophisticated-looking rolling suitcase evidently designed for diminutive travellers, navigated the terminal with an air of focused purpose. He spotted Daniel and made a beeline towards him.

"Ah, punctual," Cornelius observed, his tone conveying grudging approval. "A promising start. Let us proceed to embarkation. Delays are the spawning grounds of anteater mischief."

They joined the queue, Daniel towering over his companion. Cornelius, seemingly oblivious to the occasional curious glance cast his way, surveyed the surroundings with critical detachment. "Human logistical systems," he muttered, loud enough for Daniel to hear. "So prone to bottlenecks and arbitrary queuing protocols. Clearly no sloths involved in the design phase. Or worse, perhaps anteaters *were* involved."

Boarding the ferry was uneventful. Their shared cabin was small but functional, with two narrow bunks. Cornelius, with surprising strength, hauled his miniature suitcase onto the lower bunk and began methodically unpacking a few small items: a data slate, a miniature grooming kit, and what looked suspiciously like a tiny, sloth-sized sleeping mask.

"The crossing promises mediocrity," Cornelius announced, settling himself onto the bunk. "Turbulence levels are predicted to be minimal, unfortunately. A modicum of maritime chaos might at least provide some stimulation."

"Contentment I find in calmness, good Cornelius," Daniel replied, stowing his rucksack. "The journey ahead promises trials enough without inviting the wrath of Neptune upon our humble vessel."

The ferry horn sounded, a deep blast that vibrated through the deck, and slowly, the lights of Dover began to recede. They stood briefly on the outer deck, watching the white cliffs fade into the night.

"England falls behind," Daniel mused. "And France awaits upon the yonder shore. Another step upon this winding path to Zion."

"France," Cornelius sniffed. "Notorious for its bureaucracy. Almost certainly riddled with anteater sympathisers in positions of administrative power. We must remain vigilant."

The crossing passed uneventfully. Daniel slept fitfully, the gentle rocking of the ship and the sheer strangeness of his travelling companion making deep rest elusive. Cornelius, adorned in his sleeping mask, appeared utterly tranquil.

Disembarking in Calais felt like stepping into a different world, albeit one still governed by queues and passport control. Cornelius handled his own documentation – a small, official-looking booklet Daniel didn't get a clear look at – with practiced ease. The French officials barely blinked at the sight of a sloth presenting travel papers. Perhaps, Daniel mused, the world was simply becoming accustomed to strangeness, or perhaps Cornelius possessed some subtle form of bureaucratic camouflage.

Their next objective was the train station, Gare de Calais-Ville, and the beginning of their rail journey across Europe. Cornelius, consulting his data slate, had plotted a route: Calais to Lille, Lille to Strasbourg, Strasbourg across Germany towards Austria, and then south-eastwards through the Balkans.

"The initial legs are straightforward," Cornelius explained as they settled into seats on the train to Lille. "High-speed rail, predictable schedules. It is further east that the true inefficiencies – the potential anteater-induced complications – are likely to arise. Border crossings, differing rail gauges, geopolitical sensitivities… fertile ground for snuffling interference."

The French countryside blurred past the window, a patchwork of fields and villages under a pale morning sky. Daniel found a quiet rhythm settling over him. The absurdity of travelling with Cornelius was becoming a strange kind of normal. The sloth spent much of the time engrossed in his data slate, occasionally muttering about "suboptimal algorithms" or "predictable primate behaviour patterns."

In Lille, they navigated the station transfer, Cornelius directing Daniel with curt, precise instructions. "Platform 9 ¾ appears occupied by non-magical transport," Daniel quipped, referencing a book he'd catalogued many times.

Cornelius gave him a blank look. "Platform 11. And do try to keep up. Dawdling invites disaster, or worse, conversation with tedious fellow travellers."

The journey to Strasbourg was equally smooth. Daniel gazed out at the changing landscape, occasionally jotting notes in a small journal. He tried to engage Cornelius in conversation about history or philosophy, but the sloth seemed largely uninterested in human perspectives, unless they could somehow be linked back to the nefarious actions of anteaters.

"Ah, the Gothic splendour of Strasbourg Cathedral!" Daniel exclaimed as they glimpsed its spire upon arrival. "A testament to faith and architectural ambition!"

"A structurally inefficient design prone to wind shear," Cornelius countered without looking up from his slate. "And undoubtedly a nightmare to clean. Probably attracts pigeons. Messy creatures. Almost as bad as anteaters, in their own way."

They spent the night in a modest hotel near the station. Daniel explored the charming streets of Strasbourg briefly, feeling the weight of its complex history, caught between France and Germany. Cornelius remained in the room, apparently calculating optimal train connections through Bavaria.

The next morning, they boarded a German train, heading east. The efficiency was palpable. Trains ran on time, announcements were clear, connections seamless.

"The Germans," Cornelius conceded, peering out the window as they sped through the Black Forest. "They understand order. Less susceptible to the chaotic influences that plague other nations. Fewer anteaters in positions of power here, I suspect. Though one must never be complacent."

Daniel found himself enjoying the rhythm of the rails, the sense of constant, purposeful movement towards his goal. Even Cornelius's relentless negativity and bizarre conspiracy theories were becoming a familiar, almost comforting, background hum. They were a team, however unlikely, navigating this strange, mandated pilgrimage together. Yet, as they travelled further east, Daniel couldn't shake a sense of unease. Cornelius's warnings about the journey becoming more complicated felt less like paranoid ramblings and more like a sober assessment of the path ahead. The smooth efficiency of Western Europe could not last forever. Sooner or later, the rails would lead them into less predictable territory.

***

# Chapter 6: Whispers and Shadows in the East

The transition was subtle at first. As their train crossed from Austria into Hungary, the landscape remained picturesque, but the feel of the journey began to shift. The sleek, modern carriages of the German and Austrian lines gave way to older, slightly shabbier rolling stock. Schedules seemed a touch more elastic, station announcements less frequent and harder to decipher.

Cornelius became noticeably more agitated. He peered suspiciously at fellow passengers, scrutinised conductors, and frequently consulted his data slate, muttering about "potential deviations" and "unforeseen variables."

"The tendrils of inefficiency are tightening," he whispered to Daniel as they waited on a drafty platform in Budapest for their connection towards Romania. "Can you feel it? The air itself feels… less structured. Fertile ground for anteater meddling."

"Or perchance 'tis but the natural variation 'twixt nations and their ways, good Cornelius," Daniel suggested, though he too felt a change in atmosphere. There was a tension here, a sense of lives lived closer to the bone, that hadn't been present in the affluent West.

It was also in Budapest that the need for discretion became more apparent. While Daniel's purpose – Aliyah – was perfectly legal, the sheer oddity of their mandated journey, coupled with Cornelius's… unique nature, felt like something best kept under wraps. Explaining their "sustainable pilgrimage" invited bewildered questions and unwanted attention. Mentioning Israel in certain contexts felt increasingly unwise as they moved further east, closer to regions where geopolitical currents ran strong and deep.

They began to develop a cover story. They were eccentric naturalists, Daniel explained (using simpler language than his usual mode), studying migratory patterns – his own being a rather abstract migration, and Cornelius… well, Cornelius was a particularly rare specimen requiring careful handling.

"Naturalists?" Cornelius scoffed when Daniel first proposed it. "A discipline riddled with observational bias and taxonomic inconsistencies! And implying *I* am merely being 'handled'? The impudence!"

"Needs must when the devil, or perchance the anteater, drives, my friend," Daniel replied patiently. "A simple tale, easily told, that deflects unwanted scrutiny from our true purpose and destination."

Cornelius grumbled but eventually conceded the logic. "Very well. But if anyone attempts to tag me, I shall deploy defensive measures involving precise application of my claws."

Their journey through Romania and Bulgaria was a slow crawl on aging trains that rattled and swayed through vast agricultural plains and shadowed mountain passes. Stations were often chaotic, thronged with people, thick with cigarette smoke and the smell of unfamiliar food. Daniel found it fascinating, a glimpse into lives and landscapes utterly different from his own. Cornelius found it infuriating.

"Look at this scheduling!" he fumed, pointing a claw at a timetable riddled with handwritten annotations and crossings-out. "Utter chaos! Predictably unpredictable! An anteater would feel right at home in this system!"

They learned to be resourceful. Finding food sometimes involved deciphering Cyrillic menus or relying on gestures. Securing tickets for onward journeys required patience and persistence. They slept in cheap guesthouses near railway lines, the rumble of passing freight trains shaking the thin walls.

It was during a long, slow overnight journey towards the Bulgarian border with Turkey that Cornelius shared more of his own story. The cramped compartment, the darkness outside, and perhaps the shared vulnerability of their situation seemed to loosen his usually guarded tongue.

He spoke not of AI or global conspiracies, but of the rainforest, green and suffocatingly humid. He described the canopy, the screech of unseen creatures, the constant, damp heat. And then, his voice barely a whisper, he spoke of his father.

"He was… formidable," Cornelius murmured, staring out at the blackness rushing past the window. "Strong claws, a keen sense of direction. Master of the upper branches. Taught me the best leaves, the safest routes." He paused, his small body tense. "Then… the monkeys came. A troop of them, noisy, aggressive brutes. Always causing trouble."

Daniel listened silently, sensing the depth of the pain behind the sloth's usually cynical facade.

"There was a confrontation," Cornelius continued, his voice tight. "Over a particularly choice cluster of Cecropia leaves. My father… he stood his ground. He shouldn't have. One of them… a large male, vicious…" He trailed off, unable or unwilling to articulate the final moment. "I saw it happen. From a higher branch. Helpless."

A long silence filled the small compartment, broken only by the rhythmic clatter of the train wheels.

"Anteaters?" Daniel asked softly, unsure if it was the right thing to say.

Cornelius let out a shaky breath. "No," he admitted, the word heavy with resignation. "No, this… this was just savagery. Primate brutality. Though," he added, a flicker of his old self returning, "one cannot discount the possibility that the monkeys were acting under duress, perhaps manipulated by unseen anteater influences sowing discord in the ecosystem."

He then spoke, disjointedly, of leaving South America shortly after. He mentioned a bewildering journey, facilitated by "certain contacts" he wouldn't elaborate on, that somehow took him through the vast, windswept plains of Mongolia – a geographical leap he glossed over with frustrating vagueness – before eventually arriving in Europe. The conference in London had been the latest stop on a rootless existence, until the Aliyah opportunity, and its bizarre travel stipulation, had presented itself.

"So you see," Cornelius concluded, his voice regaining some of its usual dryness, "this journey, this… sustainable farce… it is merely another stage in a life already characterised by geographical absurdity and the inescapable idiocy of other species."

Daniel felt a pang of sympathy for the small, arrogant creature beside him. Beneath the cynicism and the bizarre obsessions, there was genuine trauma, a lingering scar from a world far removed from European railways and bureaucratic directives. Their shared journey, strange as it was, seemed to be forging a bond deeper than mere convenience. They were two displaced souls, travelling towards a promised land, carrying burdens both visible and unseen. The shadows of the East felt deeper now, filled not just with potential delays and geopolitical tensions, but with the echoes of personal histories and the ghosts of jungles past.

# Chapter 7: Turkish Delights and Simian Encounters

Crossing into Turkey felt like passing through another veil. The air grew warmer, the landscape drier, the call to prayer echoing faintly from distant minarets replacing the chime of church bells. Istanbul, when they finally reached it after a final, gruelling train leg, was a sensory explosion – a chaotic, vibrant confluence of East and West sprawled across two continents.

"Magnificent!" Daniel breathed, standing amidst the throng near Sirkeci Station, the traditional terminus of the Orient Express. "Constantinople! Byzantium! A city steeped in layers of empire, faith, and intrigue!"

"And humidity," Cornelius added, fanning himself with a leaflet he'd acquired. "Excessive humidity. And the infrastructure appears… organically complex. Which is to say, inefficiently labyrinthine. Doubtless conducive to anteater operations."

Navigating Istanbul required all their combined resourcefulness. They found lodging in a small guesthouse in the Sultanahmet district, a maze of narrow streets filled with the scent of roasting kebabs and fragrant tea. Their cover story as naturalists seemed to hold, though Daniel felt their progress was being subtly monitored. Glances lingered a little too long; questions about their ultimate destination, deflected politely, were sometimes met with knowing silence. The geopolitical sensitivity Cornelius had warned of felt palpable here, a crossroads nation balancing delicate relationships. Keeping their Israeli destination absolutely secret became paramount.

They needed to arrange the next stage: travel southwards, likely involving a combination of buses or trains towards the Mediterranean coast, and then the final, uncertain sea passage to Israel. This required careful inquiries at travel agencies and transport hubs, conducted with maximum discretion.

It was during one such reconnaissance mission, exploring the sprawling, chaotic bus terminal on the outskirts of the city, that they had their next unexpected encounter. Daniel was attempting to decipher a complex bus schedule, while Cornelius perched on his rucksack, scanning the crowds with vigilant suspicion.

Suddenly, a large, hairy hand clapped Daniel on the shoulder, causing him to jump. He turned to see a cheerful, barrel-chested man beaming at him. Except, it wasn't entirely a man. While humanoid in shape and dressed in loose-fitting trousers and a colourful shirt, the figure possessed unmistakably simian features – a broad, whiskered face, long arms, and expressive, intelligent brown eyes. He looked like an exceptionally well-dressed, bipedal orangutan.

"Lost, my friend?" the creature boomed, his voice a gravelly, good-natured rumble. "This place, she is a madness, no? Even for one such as I, who knows the ways of the jungle and the city!"

Daniel stared, momentarily speechless. Another talking animal. This one, however, radiated an infectious bonhomie utterly unlike Cornelius's prickly demeanour.

Cornelius, atop the rucksack, stiffened immediately. His fur bristled, and a low growl escaped his throat. "Primate," he hissed, his voice dripping with primal animosity.

The orangutan-like creature looked down, his smile faltering slightly as he noticed Cornelius. "Ah," he said, his eyes widening in surprise. "A little one! And… oh my. A sloth, is it not? And speaking?" He chuckled, a deep, rumbling sound. "The wonders of this modern age never cease! I am Rizvan," he added, offering a large hand to Daniel, ignoring Cornelius's glare.

"Daniel," Daniel replied, shaking the offered hand, which was surprisingly gentle. "And this… this is Cornelius."

"Charmed," Rizvan boomed, giving Cornelius a polite nod, which the sloth pointedly ignored. "You travel far?"

"Indeed," Daniel said cautiously, sticking to the cover story. "We study… patterns. Movements. Across lands."

"Ah, scholars!" Rizvan beamed. "Excellent! I myself am involved in… logistics. Facilitating movement, you might say. Mostly goods, sometimes people. Always complicated in this part of the world." He winked. "Perhaps I can assist fellow travellers?"

Cornelius shifted. "We require no assistance from… *your* kind," he spat, the memory of his father's fate clearly triggered.

Rizvan looked momentarily hurt, then seemed to understand. He sighed, a surprisingly human sound. "The old conflicts run deep, little sloth. Even with the… enhancements… some instincts remain. My apologies if my presence disturbs you. The jungles of Borneo hold their own harsh tales, believe me." He turned back to Daniel. "But my offer stands. If you seek passage south, perhaps towards the coast… Mersin? Iskenderun? I know reliable drivers, discreet routes. Sometimes, the official ways are not the smoothest, eh?"

Daniel hesitated. Rizvan seemed genuine, friendly even. But trusting a stranger, especially one who seemed unnervingly well-informed about discreet travel, felt risky given their need for secrecy. Cornelius's hostility, though rooted in personal trauma, also served as a warning.

"Thy offer is most gracious, Master Rizvan," Daniel said carefully. "But our plans are yet… fluid. We must consult our maps and observations."

"As you wish, as you wish!" Rizvan clapped him on the shoulder again. "But Istanbul is a city of whispers. If you need a quiet word, ask for Rizvan near the Spice Bazaar. Someone will find me." He gave Cornelius another wary, almost sad look, then turned and ambled off, disappearing easily into the bustling crowd.

"Fraternising with primates!" Cornelius hissed as soon as Rizvan was out of earshot. "Have you lost your senses? Did my story teach you nothing? They are treacherous, violent! And that one… 'logistics'? 'Discreet routes'? He reeks of subterfuge! Probably an agent of the Anteater Collective, using simian muscle!"

"He seemed… jovial," Daniel countered, though Rizvan's easy offer of clandestine travel had unsettled him too. "And perhaps his knowledge could prove useful. The path southward is unclear."

"Usefulness procured from a monkey is paid for with bananas or betrayal!" Cornelius snapped. "We proceed according to *my* calculations, relying on verifiable schedules and minimizing contact with dubious anthropoids and their inevitable anteater handlers!"

Despite Cornelius's protests, Rizvan's appearance lingered in Daniel's thoughts. Was he truly just a helpful local, another奇蹟 of the strange new world of talking animals? Or was he something more, a player in the shadowy games played at the crossroads of continents? Their need for secrecy felt more pressing than ever. They gathered information cautiously, piecing together a route involving a long bus journey south towards the Turkish Mediterranean coast, a region closer to the volatile Syrian border. From there, they hoped to find a ship, any ship, willing to make the final, perilous crossing towards the shores of Israel. The jovial monkey's offer echoed in Daniel's mind, a tempting shortcut fraught with unknown risks, while Cornelius's warnings about primates and anteaters alike cast long shadows over the path ahead.

# Chapter 8: The Salt-Stained Deck and The Final Passage

The bus journey south was arduous. Days blurred into a landscape of dusty plains, olive groves, and small, sun-baked towns. The vehicle was crowded, noisy, and prone to unscheduled stops. Daniel practiced his limited Turkish, engaging in halting conversations, while Cornelius mostly remained silent, perched stoically on the seat beside him, occasionally muttering about subpar suspension systems and the ever-present threat of dust mites ("likely cousins to the anteater, taxonomically speaking").

They avoided any mention of Israel, sticking resolutely to their vague naturalist cover story. In the cramped confines of the bus, surrounded by strangers, the need for discretion felt absolute. Daniel found himself constantly scanning faces, wondering who might be listening, who might harbour suspicions.

They finally reached Mersin, a sprawling port city on the Mediterranean coast. The air was thick with salt and the smell of fish. Ships of all sizes crowded the harbour – container vessels, fishing boats, sleek yachts, and rusty freighters. Somewhere among them, Daniel hoped, lay their passage to the Promised Land.

Finding such passage proved immensely challenging. Official ferry services to Israel were nonexistent due to the political climate. Inquiring about informal or cargo routes was met with suspicion, shrugged shoulders, or outright refusal. Rizvan's offer back in Istanbul echoed temptingly, but they had no way of contacting him now, and Cornelius remained vehemently opposed to seeking simian assistance.

"Patience and logic will prevail," Cornelius insisted, though even his certainty seemed slightly frayed by days of fruitless searching along the docks. "There must be a vessel undertaking the required vector. It is a matter of identifying the correct variables and minimizing exposure to unreliable, potentially anteater-affiliated, intermediaries."

They spent days haunting dockside cafes, observing the comings and goings, discreetly asking questions. Daniel felt their funds dwindling, their options narrowing. Despair began to gnaw at the edges of his resolve once more. Was this the final, insurmountable hurdle? To come so far, only to be stranded on the shores of the Mediterranean?

"Behold, Cornelius!" Daniel exclaimed one sweltering afternoon, pointing towards a dilapidated but seaworthy-looking fishing trawler tied up at a far pier. Smoke curled from its galley chimney, and rough-looking sailors were mending nets on deck. Its name, painted in faded letters on the stern, was *Deniz Yıldızı* – Starfish. "Perchance these hardy sons of the sea might brave the southward passage?"

Cornelius eyed the vessel dubiously. "Its seaworthiness appears marginal. And fishermen are notoriously unpredictable. Still," he conceded, "conventional options have proven fruitless. A cautious inquiry may be warranted. Allow me to handle the preliminary negotiations. My diminutive size often leads humans to underestimate my intellect, a tactical advantage."

Before Daniel could agree, Cornelius had deftly scrambled down from the harbourside wall and was ambling purposefully towards the *Deniz Yıldızı*. Daniel watched, heart in mouth, as the small sloth approached the sailors. He saw them stop their work, stare, point, and then, surprisingly, break into laughter. One of them, a burly man with a weathered face and a captain's cap perched jauntily on his head, knelt down to speak with Cornelius.

The conversation went on for some time, Cornelius gesturing with his claws, the captain occasionally nodding or roaring with laughter. Finally, Cornelius turned and ambled back towards Daniel, his expression unreadable.

"Well?" Daniel asked anxiously. "What fortune, brave negotiator?"

"The captain, a man named Yusuf, is… amenable," Cornelius reported, dusting off his fur. "He finds the concept of a talking sloth seeking passage to the vicinity of Haifa utterly hilarious. Apparently, it's the strangest request he's had all year."

"Haifa? He sails to Israel?" Daniel pressed, hope surging.

"Not directly," Cornelius clarified. "His route takes him along the coast, fishing. He makes landfall occasionally for supplies, sometimes near the Lebanese border, sometimes further south. He is willing, for an exorbitant fee naturally, to deposit us discreetly on a suitable beach somewhat north of Haifa, under cover of darkness. He makes no guarantees regarding border patrols or the reception committee."

It was risky. Incredibly risky. But it was the only viable option they had found.

"The price?" Daniel asked.

Cornelius named a figure that made Daniel wince, representing almost the last of his travel funds.

"It is steep," Cornelius acknowledged. "But desperation, like anteaters, drives up costs. He also requires our assistance with galley duties. Apparently, his usual cook jumped ship in Antalya."

Daniel looked at the *Deniz Yıldızı*, then back at Cornelius. Galley duties on a fishing trawler in exchange for a clandestine landing on the shores of Israel, guided by a laughing captain and accompanied by a conspiracy-obsessed sloth. It was the epitome of their bizarre journey.

"Then let us be cooks upon the wine-dark sea!" Daniel declared, a reckless grin spreading across his face. "If scrubbing pots be the price of Zion, then scrub we shall!"

They paid Captain Yusuf, hauled their meagre belongings aboard, and that evening, under a star-strewn sky, the *Deniz Yıldızı* slipped its moorings and chugged out of Mersin harbour, turning south into the dark expanse of the Mediterranean.

Life aboard the trawler was rough, cramped, and relentlessly pungent with the smell of fish and diesel. Daniel, surprisingly adept, found himself peeling potatoes and washing dishes in the small, rocking galley. Cornelius, despite his initial complaints about manual labour being beneath his intellectual station, proved remarkably meticulous at sorting fish and cleaning surfaces, all the while providing a running commentary on the captain's inefficient navigation techniques and the high probability of encountering Zionist-trained anteater naval units.

The sailors, a rough but generally good-natured crew, treated them with a mixture of amusement and bafflement. Daniel's Shakespearean pronouncements and Cornelius's articulate complaints became sources of onboard entertainment. Captain Yusuf, when not bellowing orders or laughing at his unusual passengers, shared stories of the sea, his eyes twinkling with mischief.

Days passed in a rhythm of nets cast and hauled, meals cooked and consumed, the endless blue of the sea stretching in all directions. They sailed south, keeping a wary distance from the Syrian and Lebanese coasts. The tension onboard grew as they neared their clandestine destination.

Finally, one moonless night, Captain Yusuf cut the main engines, the boat wallowing gently in the swell. "There," he pointed towards the dark shoreline, barely visible miles away. "Beyond those lights lies Haifa. We drop you here. The dinghy will take you closer. Good luck, strange travellers."

The small inflatable dinghy was lowered over the side. Daniel and Cornelius clambered in, along with one silent sailor tasked with rowing them ashore. As they pulled away from the *Deniz Yıldızı*, Daniel looked back at the receding lights of the trawler.

"Farewell, Captain Yusuf! May thy nets be ever full, and thy path free from the Kraken's grasp… and anteaters!" Daniel called out. A gruff laugh echoed back across the water.

The dinghy moved silently through the darkness, the only sound the dip and splash of the oars. The shore loomed closer, a black silhouette against the slightly less black sky. Daniel could feel his heart pounding. This was it. The final, uncertain step.

With a soft scrape, the dinghy grounded on sand. The sailor gestured for them to get out quickly. Daniel scrambled onto the beach, hauling his rucksack, then helped Cornelius ashore. The sailor pushed the dinghy back into the water and rowed swiftly away, vanishing into the night.

They stood alone on the dark beach, the gentle lapping of waves at their feet. Somewhere inland, unseen, lay the land they had journeyed so long and so strangely to reach. Israel.

"We have arrived, Cornelius," Daniel whispered, his voice filled with awe and exhaustion. "Against all odds, against all reason… we are here."

Cornelius surveyed the dark beach, sniffing the air. "Hmmph," he grunted. "The sand quality seems adequate. Minimal signs of recent anteater activity. For now." He looked up at Daniel. "Well, human. Don't just stand there gawking. The final leg of this ridiculous pilgrimage awaits. Towards Jerusalem, I presume?"

Daniel smiled. "Aye, Cornelius. Towards Jerusalem." Together, man and sloth turned and began walking inland, disappearing into the darkness of the Promised Land.

# Chapter 9: The Holy City and The Baffled Bureaucrats

The journey from the coast to Jerusalem was less perilous than the voyage that preceded it, but possessed its own unique set of challenges. Hitchhiking again felt too risky; their clandestine arrival necessitated keeping a low profile until they could officially register. They travelled by a combination of shared taxis (*sheruts*) and infrequent local buses, Daniel's dwindling funds dictating the pace.

Their cover story shifted slightly. They were now simply tourists who had enjoyed an extended, unconventional tour of Turkey and fancied seeing the Holy Land. Daniel's Shakespearean speech patterns drew curious glances, but in a land accustomed to a myriad of languages and eccentric pilgrims, it barely registered as remarkable. Cornelius, usually perched on Daniel's rucksack or occasionally riding inside it with only his head poking out, mostly garnered reactions of amused curiosity rather than alarm. The prevalence of backpackers with peculiar travel companions perhaps normalised their appearance to some degree.

"Observe the proliferation of felines," Cornelius remarked as they navigated the bustling streets of Tel Aviv, their first major stop. "An overabundance, indicative of potential ecosystem imbalance. Or perhaps," he lowered his voice conspiratorially, "a deliberate anteater ploy to distract from their subterranean burrowing activities."

Daniel, however, was captivated. The energy of Tel Aviv, the Hebrew signs, the sheer, vibrant *Jewishness* of the place resonated deep within him. This was the modern heart of the nation he had dreamed of from afar. Yet, Jerusalem remained the ultimate goal, the ancient soul.

The final bus ride climbed steadily, the landscape changing from coastal plain to rocky hills dotted with pine and olive trees. As they rounded a bend, the golden dome of the Rock shimmered in the distance, nestled amidst the pale stone buildings of the Old City.

"Jerusalem," Daniel breathed, his hand instinctively going to his heart. "Behold! The city of gold, of stone, of spirit!"

Even Cornelius seemed momentarily subdued by the sight, though he quickly recovered. "Architecturally significant, I concede. Though likely plagued by inadequate sanitation systems dating back millennia. And tourists. Endless streams of tourists. Highly inefficient."

Their arrival in Jerusalem marked the end of one journey and the beginning of another: navigating the final stage of the Aliyah process. They needed to present themselves to the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration, explain their unorthodox arrival, and complete their registration as new citizens.

Finding the correct office building within the sprawling government complex on Kaplan Street was a challenge in itself. After several false starts and confusing directions, they found themselves in a brightly lit, air-conditioned waiting room filled with other immigrants from around the world – Russians, Ethiopians, Americans, French – a microcosm of the ingathering they had joined.

When their number was finally called, they were ushered into a small office where a tired-looking official sat behind a desk piled high with paperwork. Her name tag identified her as Rivka. She looked up, blinked at Daniel, then did a double-take as she registered Cornelius perched calmly on the chair beside him.

"Shalom," Rivka said, her voice betraying a hint of weariness. "Welcome. You are… Daniel O'Connell? From Ireland?"

"The very same, good madam," Daniel confirmed with a slight bow. "Late of Dublin, more recently of sundry European railways, Turkish buses, and a certain fishing vessel upon the Great Sea. Come at last to Zion's gate, albeit by a path most curious."

Rivka stared at him, then glanced at Cornelius, who offered a curt nod. "And… this is…?"

"Cornelius," the sloth interjected before Daniel could reply. "Designation: Exceptional Fauna, Aliyah Pilot Program Participant, Sub-category: AI-Augmented *Bradypodidae*. My documentation should be on file. Though," he added darkly, "given the pervasive incompetence inherent in most large bureaucracies, likely exacerbated by anteater infiltration, one cannot be certain."

Rivka blinked slowly. She typed something into her computer, peered at the screen, typed again, and then looked back at them, utter bafflement written across her features.

"Mr. O'Connell," she began, choosing her words carefully. "Your visa was approved months ago. We have you on record. But the file notes… a requirement for sustainable travel?" She frowned. "And… Cornelius?" She typed his name. "Yes, here you are. Exceptional Fauna Pilot Program… participant… also sustainable travel required." She looked from Daniel to Cornelius and back again, shaking her head slightly. "There must be some mistake. The sustainable travel initiative… it was a proposal. A pilot study for *future* policy. Highly controversial. It was never meant to be applied retroactively, especially not to… well, to individuals travelling from Ireland. Or," she gestured vaguely at Cornelius, "to participants in the Fauna program originating outside contiguous regions. The logistics are impossible!"

"Impossible, perhaps. Yet accomplished, madam!" Daniel declared, puffing out his chest slightly. "Through trials by train and tribulations by trawler, we have traversed the breadth of Europe! We have faced down dubious schedules, navigated suspicious border guards, even peeled potatoes upon the high seas! All in accordance with the directive received!"

Cornelius nodded agreement. "The inefficiency was staggering. The potential for anteater-related disruption, ever-present. Yet, through superior intellect," he glanced pointedly at Daniel, "and dogged persistence, we prevailed."

Rivka stared at them, speechless for a moment. She picked up her phone, dialled an internal number, and began speaking rapidly in Hebrew, her voice rising in pitch. Daniel caught snippets – "Irish Oleh," "talking sloth," "fishing boat," "sustainable travel mandate," "utter madness."

She put the phone down, looking flustered. "My supervisor… he is coming. He… he doesn't believe me."

Minutes later, a portly, balding man with harried eyes hurried into the office. Rivka quickly explained the situation again in Hebrew. The supervisor listened, his expression shifting from scepticism to incredulity, then to sheer, unadulterated astonishment as he looked from Daniel's earnest face to Cornelius's impassive one.

He turned to Daniel. "You… you actually travelled from Ireland… by land and sea? Because of that memo?"

"Indeed, sir," Daniel confirmed. "A directive received is a directive obeyed, though the logic thereof be as tangled as the Gordian knot!"

The supervisor sank into the spare chair, running a hand over his bald head. "The Green Initiative memo," he muttered. "From the Ministry of Environmental Protection liaison… it was circulated for comment, not implementation! Someone in processing must have… misfiled it? Activated the protocol by mistake? Oy gevalt." He looked at them both, a strange mix of horror and grudging admiration in his eyes. "The journey you must have had…"

"Arduous," Cornelius stated flatly. "And unnecessarily complicated by primate-dominated transportation networks."

The supervisor stared at Cornelius, then back at Daniel. He seemed lost for words. He picked up the phone again. "I need to call the Minister's office," he mumbled. "And maybe the Knesset Oversight Committee. This… this is unprecedented."

Daniel and Cornelius exchanged a glance. Their bizarre, mandated odyssey, born of bureaucratic error and compounded by their own determination, had apparently sent ripples all the way to the top. They had reached Jerusalem, not just as immigrants, but as living, breathing (and occasionally complaining) evidence of a policy gone wildly astray.

***

# Chapter 10: Aftermath and Ascent

The days following their arrival at the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration were a whirlwind of interviews, debriefings, and bewildered apologies from increasingly senior officials. Daniel recounted their journey – the hitchhiking, the absinthe-tinged meeting in London, the trains across Europe, the encounters with border guards, the jovial monkey, the Turkish bus rides, the fishing trawler – his Shakespearean eloquence lending an epic quality to the tale of bureaucratic folly. Cornelius provided corroborating details, interspersed with sharp critiques of transport infrastructure and dark warnings about ever-present anteater conspiracies ("Mark my words, the initial memo misfiling bears all the hallmarks of their clumsy, snuffling interference!").

Their story became something of a sensation within the halls of government. The sheer absurdity of their enforced "sustainable" pilgrimage from Ireland highlighted the disconnect between well-intentioned policy proposals and practical reality. The "Green Initiative memo," intended as a think-piece, had somehow been actioned by an overzealous or perhaps simply confused clerk, setting in motion a chain of events that culminated in an Irishman and a talking sloth washing up on a beach north of Haifa after weeks of arduous surface travel.

News of their ordeal reached the Knesset, Israel's parliament. The Oversight Committee for Immigration and Absorption launched an immediate inquiry. Officials from the Ministry of Integration, the Ministry of Environmental Protection, and the Jewish Agency were called to testify. Rivka and her supervisor recounted their initial baffling encounter with the unlikely pair. Captain Yusuf, tracked down via maritime records, even provided a bemused statement via radio confirming his role in the final leg of their journey (though he wisely omitted the clandestine nature of the landing).

Daniel and Cornelius were invited to address the committee, albeit in a closed session. Daniel, standing before the assembled politicians, spoke passionately, not with anger, but with a plea for sense and sensibility.

"Honourable members," he began, his voice echoing slightly in the chamber, "whilst the aim of stewardship o'er this fragile earth is noble, prithee, let not the execution thereof place burdens undue upon souls yearning for Zion's embrace! The path of Aliyah is fraught enough with trials of spirit and of purse, without demanding that pilgrims traverse continents like vagabonds of yore, reliant on the whims of fortune and the questionable seaworthiness of fishing fleets!"

Cornelius, granted permission to speak from a small stool placed beside the main podium, offered a more pointed critique. "The logistical framework underpinning this 'sustainable' mandate was, to employ understatement, suboptimal. It lacked consideration for geographical realities, existing transport infrastructure, and the inherent vulnerabilities of travellers – particularly non-human participants subjected to primate-centric systems. Furthermore," he added, his eyes narrowing, "the entire fiasco suggests a critical lack of oversight, creating fertile ground for disruptive elements. Namely, anteaters."

The committee members listened, a mixture of embarrassment, amusement, and genuine concern on their faces. The final report was swift and decisive. It acknowledged the "grievous error" in applying the draft policy to Daniel and Cornelius, offered a formal apology, and strongly recommended a thorough review of all internal procedures to prevent such mistakes in the future. It specifically critiqued the sustainable travel proposal itself, deeming it "impractical and potentially dangerous" for immigrants travelling from distant locations, effectively shelving the idea indefinitely. Their arduous journey had, inadvertently, prompted a course correction in immigration policy.

In the meantime, Daniel and Cornelius were finally processed as official *Olim Chadashim* (new immigrants). They were provided with temporary housing in an absorption center in Jerusalem, given their identity cards, and offered the standard package of support for newcomers – language classes (*ulpan*), assistance with job searching, and introductions to the complexities of Israeli life.

Daniel threw himself into *ulpan*, eager to master the Hebrew tongue he had previously only encountered in prayer books and online recordings. His natural linguistic flair, even filtered through his Shakespearean default, served him well. He explored Jerusalem with wide-eyed wonder, wandering the ancient alleyways of the Old City, visiting the Western Wall, and soaking in the vibrant, challenging, multifaceted reality of the city he had dreamed of for so long. The feeling of being 'out of place' that had shadowed his youth in Ireland began to dissipate, replaced by the complex, sometimes contradictory, but undeniable feeling of finally being home.

Cornelius, too, began to adapt, albeit in his own unique way. He spent hours on his data slate, apparently researching local sloth habitats (finding them conspicuously absent) and monitoring global reports for signs of anteater activity ("Increased seismic readings near the Dead Sea? Suspiciously timed with reports of missing picnic baskets? Coincidence? I think not!"). He occasionally accompanied Daniel on exploratory walks, offering cynical commentary on everything from falafel quality ("Nutritionally unbalanced!") to the driving habits of Jerusalemites ("Utterly devoid of logic!"). His long-term plans remained focused on eventually visiting his fellow talking sloths in Korea and Japan, but for now, Jerusalem was his base. The question of whether he was 'real' or a lingering figment of absinthe and wishful thinking remained unanswered, and Daniel found he no longer cared. Cornelius was simply… Cornelius. His companion.

Their journey had been improbable, perilous, and often preposterous. Born of bureaucracy, sustained by resilience, and navigated by an unlikely duo, it had ended not just with their arrival, but with an unexpected impact. As Daniel stood one evening, looking out over the Judean hills as the setting sun painted the sky in hues of orange and gold, he felt a sense of profound peace. The path had been far stranger than he could ever have conceived, but it had led him here. He had made Aliyah. He had ascended.

"A fair vista, is it not, Cornelius?" he murmured.

The sloth, perched on the balcony railing beside him, surveyed the scene. "Adequate," he conceded. "Though the atmospheric haze suggests suboptimal air quality. And I remain convinced there's an anteater burrow somewhere down there, plotting."

Daniel simply smiled. The adventure was over. The homecoming had begun.
